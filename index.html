                        The purpose of this protocol, is to ensure that every Preseed Team members’
                        communication is effective
                        and uniform so that we all follow certain protocols that define our
                        communications
                        well with each other.
                        Key here is to be fast and mindful. Empathise with other team members who you
                        are
                        communicating with.
                        Any questions or suggestions please feel free to share with the Coordinators.

                    <li>Team communication happens on Whatsapp, Slack and Telegram. These are our our
                        work
                        spaces.</li>
                    <li>Communication be instant please. Have the above apps, Gdrive, Gmail and Trello
                        on
                        all your devices so as
                        to avoid delay in replies.</li>
                    <li>People already get a lot of actionable emails to deal with on a daily basis so
                        cut
                        it out with the
                        repetitive formalities</li>
                    <li>For example “ Hi! How are you”, unless you are really concerned. How is the
                        weather
                        etc.“ I mean just
                        get straight to the point.</li>
                    <li>Communication of Preseed team on Slack (even between 2 individuals) is
                        encouraged to happen on relevant ​*team channels / groups*​ and ​*not DM’s*​ so that the rest of the team can be
                        included as well as learn from the conversation that takes place. Another reason is to be able to
                        amplify the reach of messages (when needed) and protocols from Preseed team to reach other teams in
                        Preseed — which in turn maximizes the impact of the talk. Following this will also reduce redundancy on
                        similar matters of discussion. For ex. check this screenshot</li>

                           1. First and most important protocol no excuse would be accepted for any low quality work. Maintain standards.<br>
    2. Communication at Light Speed. Team members must acknowledge and respond due diligently. Absolutely no failure in work will be tolerated due communication lag.<br>
    3. All hackers working on pages should setup repositories in their own github account. ie. they should host the pages while in development stage on their github account for exchanging opinions in the workgroup as screen shots don’t work.<br>
    4. All exchange of opinions on any design while the page is being worked upon should take place on the work group.<br>
    5. If any page has been finalized, same should be mentioned and the live page to be shared in the workgroup. ie. the page that is hosted on the person’s github account (the person who was assigned the task) to be shared here before calling it done. After the page has been approved only then it can be hosted on the preseed account.<br>
    6. When tasks are complete either on producteev of facebook workgroup update as done.<br>
    7. Any Documents made for better direction of tasks should be shared with Yatharth or the Coordinator; Also wait for their inputs. This is a failsafe in case of early corrections.<br>
    8. Check out the documents for coding guidelines.<br>
    9. all new pages must be implemented/coded in the latest available framework versions. ie. for every new design, implementation should start by downloading the fresh version from getbootstrap.com or the framework being used for laying out the design.<br>
    10. Makes pull requests with relevant descriptions.<br>
    11. Structure. Structure. This includes updating the commit text on Github<br><br>
    
    Please have a proper structure to the codes. Folder structure:<br><br>
    
    Directory structure to be-<br><br>
    1. assets/css/ — for css<br>
    2. assets/img/- for images<br>
    3. assets/js/ — for javascript<br>
    4. bootstrap/css- for css files which come along with bootstrap<br>
    5. bootstrap/js/ — for js files of bootstrap<br>
    6. index.html- home page<br>
    7. assets/fonts- for fonts<br>

                            The purpose of the Feedback Response Policy is important for shaping our product. Instead of reaching out to new users it is important for us to first know our existing users through feedback and serve them really well. We need to know how they're using our product and how we can make the product better suit their needs.
    Every new feature should have a strong feedback system.
    
    Tech team members must know what platform is the feedback coming from, to who, and from who, in the team (for ex. Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, Gmail, Freshdesk etc.). Also, keep a close track on- what percentage of feedbacks are coming from which platform. Keeping a track of the platforms will somewhere help while formulating marketing strategies because we'll know what platforms our users mostly use. We would know the unique user the feedback is coming from but for analysis purpose we will have to club the feedbacks together that are similar in nature to see the ones that are common. While some feedbacks may look similar but in reality they might be very different from each other. So clubbing of feedbacks need to be done intelligently. The bottom line is we have to know what the users are trying to tell us, and try to ensure that it's taken care of. This will lead to a healthy business and formation of a company with a strong foundation that has the customer's best interest in its heart.

                    How are teams built? - Other team members' contribution to finding new talents for their team is
                    paramount.
                    Each one should take upon themselves in growing their teams. So I am clearly saying if you talent
                    around you
                    with counter culture beliefs that resonate with Preseed values, create introductions of such people with
                    us,
                     along with your views on what agenda could we build upon with the fellow being you have found for

                    <br>
                    Delegation of work - MOST IMPORTANT Everyone must learn over a period of time of course, 'the art of
                    building their own team'. <br> The biggest attribute we see in our people is 'how well can they inspire
                    others to
                    work with them' if you need money to build your team then you need to see how Nishchal is building his
                    team.

                  We value simplicity - in our world we pride ourselves on our design aesthetics. This opening is not for anyone who feel their vibes flow strong with ours, unless you are someone with a subtle design sensibility and leadership fire to inspire a team of designers. Over the past few years we have learned that designers in themselves are a very different type of leader - one we would need to balance out the Reactor Core.  There are countless projects related to design going on in Preseed and your role would require you to have hawkeyes over them along with the team of extraordinary talent built around you. If your values resonate with ours - connect with someone in the team, but before that - apply.

                  In Startup Kitchen we will have one manager per cluster of startups. So in essence you have to manage a portfolio and build a network of mentors suitable for that portfolio from the day you join. Your job is essentially going to be about finding the inspired team of mentors/advisors - managing/ leading them to deliver. If you have led/managed a startup/project at the C level and want to be part of a counterculture that is set to disrupt the start-up world.
