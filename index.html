                                            The most exciting learning moment of it all was 'how to build an ego less
                                            company' - What does that even mean? It means a company without any door or
                                            roof or body or shape. No, ego less company is not a word that has been used
                                            ever perhaps, I coined it to explain yet another fundamentally different
                                            attribute of our company. The advantage of running a company like this is
                                            that I don't have to waste too much time in hiring or firing people, people
                                            can come in freely and walk out freely. THE GOODNESS OF THIS STRATEGY LIES
                                            IN THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO COME IN AND DON'T LEAVE.

                                        <br><br> I put the first word about Preseed in feb of 2012. Since then we have

                                        long way forward. From no money in my pocket and 1 person to no money in my
                                        pocket and 15+ people team. That means a lot of things, but this post is not
                                        about what all that could means, since, all that I have already indicated
                                        across my various writings about Preseed. This post is to describe how I

                                        handling people with my little tolerance to bull shit excuses, careless
                                        attitude towards my company and mediocrity. Oftentimes their inflated egos
                                        make them want to quit immediately after that rare outburst from me. <br><br>
                                        Well obviously there is a good in even that event of that person leaving,
                                        the problem is the going also creates that negative vibe in the company
                                        because the company of individuals does not understand that coming and going
                                        is no big deal in a liberal culture like that <br><br>
                                        One needs to understand that if I pasted them they must have deserved it.
                                        Any way startup life is not so rosy and even the rose comes with thorns. If
                                        you can keep taking those blows and keep moving forward for the sake of our
                                        mission, then you most definitely deserve a chance not only to hold the
                                        stock but to lead one day for you listened well from those whose sincerity
                                        in Preseed is unquestionable. You need to understand that if I pasted you, I
                                        did it in the best interest of our company which is one thing you can’t
                                        doubt. Try it. <br><br>
                                        For me the best interest of preseed matters far over and above pleasing
                                        anyone. I am easy but those who are careless may not find me that easy after
                                        all. Find out about the strictness of Sri Yukteswara’s attributes as a
                                        teacher to Sri Yogananda Parhamansa and Steve Jobs/Elon Musk/Larry Page’s
                                        strictness as leaders of their teams. <br><br>
                                        In this light I am pasting a screenshot of some email exchanged between I
                                        and a senior member of Preseed: <br><br>

                                        For ego stock post — 
                                        <br><br>
                                        I don’t know about 2015 but I know if in 2014 I am doing anything that does not
                                        relate to Todoed then it is not the right way to go for me. I am saying that I
                                        have brought Preseed to a point where as long as it has you guys hustling
                                        together it will keep moving forward as long as each one has the intent to be
                                        there for each other. As long as that is there we have a structure and spirit to
                                        build an extraordinary company out of such relations we are forging. <br> <br>
                                        Anyway, so I am saying that please run the company smoothly so smoothly that I
                                        don’t have to interfere. <br> <br>
                                        If I am found doing anything else in the company other that building Chattodo
                                        then know without me saying,that you guys are not doing it right. I need to
                                        focus only on Chattodo. For everything else I have laid the foundation very
                                        thoughtfully in such a way that it can all be handled with my continued
                                        directions which will always be there, especially given that I have already
                                        written everything in detail all the way to the next 5 years of our works
                                        forward. Now we just have to fill the dots most of which are already indicated.
                                        Basically, I feel the blueprint is already created. Now we have to see how well
                                        you guys collaborate among each other and cooperate with each other. Just
                                        remember it is important to empathize with those you work with to truly
                                        understand their situations and intent at all times. That will help you make
                                        right and righteous decisions for each one of us. <br> <br>
                                        Please work hard. Preseed will not only be a mulit billion-dollar company but
                                        will also be a company that will inspire generations through truth and
                                        unparalleled transparency.

                                The purpose of the Feedback Response Policy is important for shaping our product.
                                Instead of reaching out to new users it is important for us to first know our existing
                                users through feedback and serve them really well. We need to know how they're using our
                                product and how we can make the product better suit their needs. <br>
                                Every new feature should have a strong feedback system.
                                <br><br>
                                Tech team members must know what platform is the feedback coming from, to who, and from
                                who, in the team
                                (for ex. Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, Gmail, Freshdesk etc.). Also, keep a close track
                                on- what percentage of feedbacks are coming from which platform. Keeping a track of the
                                platforms will somewhere help while formulating marketing strategies because we'll know
                                what platforms our users mostly use.
                                We would know the unique user the feedback is coming from but for analysis purpose we
                                will have to club the feedbacks together that are similar in nature to see the ones that
                                are common. While some feedbacks may look similar but in reality they might be very
                                different from each other. So clubbing of feedbacks need to be done intelligently. The
                                bottom line is we have to know what the users are trying to tell us, and try to ensure
                                that it's taken care of. This will lead to a healthy business and formation of a company
                                with a strong foundation that has the customer's best interest in its heart.

                        Now we need money
                        to get to the launch ready version.
                        The app has not been publically launched and hence, has traction in only double figures.
                        Therefore, there has been no need for us yet to have dabbled in cost or revenue
                        projections.

                        <br>
                        I bring to YOU our need for a minimum of $200,000 to build a <strong>'launch worthy'</strong>
                        productivity tool as a

                                        I know there are a lot of Sunny Kesarwani's out there, just like, we are all the
                                        same, but only in our absolute silence. The moment we start surfacing after our
                                        long silence, as individuals, we realize there is just one Sunny Kesarwani, who
                                        decided to say no to all opportunities where traction and team were a far easier
                                        find. I decided to chase a chat app instead, in spite of the world of potential
                                        colleagues that thought this won't work, because the world doesn't need another
                                        chat app. Let's understand that one of us out of millions of us can be allowed
                                        to break the rule of getting to an investor before traction, because he is
                                        building a product that cannot come out as a MVP. Give me a minimum of $200,000
                                        absolutely
                                        now and let me have my team full time. In three months we will build the most
                                        beautiful chat app in the world. Then give us the rest of money to launch it to
                                        the world.

                        <i> We have developed the prototype, not the launch version of the app. Why? Like
                            we said above - just imagine, will you use a chatting app in 2017 which looks and feels
                            worse than Whatsapp, Slack, Snapchat or Fb messenger? We won't. So for us to make the
                            presence of our app felt, we must spend at least 100 thousand dollars to actually build
                            a finger licking beautiful product to launch it with the optimism that it will eat up
                            some of the market share of communication away from Whatsapp, FB messenger and Slack.
                            This implies that every waking hour of ours must go into the broad understanding of the
                            market, vision and team camaraderie first; then the development of the app, then the
                            launch of the app, and then following of metrics and somewhere along the way, dabbling
                            in projections will happen.

                            No traction yet for the main mobile app. Why? Why am I still pursuing investment when
                            there is not even a launch?
                            Because this product is about a chatapp. Chatting apps cannot be made and launched as
                            half baked MVPs for the world
                            We need investment to support the team so that our great team can continue to build a
                            great product with some confidence in the captain, that is I, that I will take care of
                            their bread and butter. Not everyone required in this team will have the same appetite
                            for risk as I.
                            Traction we have achieved so far: None. So far we were not chasing traction. We were
                            fighting personal odds and chasing a vision & design that required years of sacrifices
                            away from the norms of chasing traction common to apps with lesser time to chase vision,
                            because they are too busy chasing the incremental changes in the status quo.</i>

                        <br> <br>Peter Thiel became a billionaire by investing half a million dollars in Facebook before
                        anyone else. Today he runs a fund which has invested in some of the world’s best startups.
                        <br><br>
                        Chattodo has a similar potential. You can be an investor in it by investing a half of what Peter
                        Thiel did. This is a matter of a new kind of a social network.

                                        For now, let's turn the lens on another kind of traction- which we have
                                        already created- meaningful moments and activities noticed by users, media
                                        and the tech community. <br><br>
                                        I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing
                                        traction instead of a chasing a world changing vision which did not fit the
                                        bill for the rule of - build MVP - followed by traction, before I could
                                        raise money. Please tell me how I would then change the world for the

                                        Start-up land is littered with failure. <br><br>
                                        Every hack on smart investing will preach that before approaching an
                                        investor you must have dragged your feet over the thorns littered over that
                                        holiest of grails- TRACTION. For after all what good is a business that does
                                        not yield profits? Yet, if that critical question on TRACTION is duly asked
                                        and answered before any investment, why the high rates of failure and a
                                        subsequent celebration of failure as the norm in start-up land?
                                        Could it be that the holy grail itself is flawed in a period where most of
                                        our problems have been solved or are perceived to have been solved to an
                                        acceptable degree beyond which improvements are not possible in a human,
                                        hence imperfect world? <br><br>
                                        I say YES. <br><br>
                                        Most start-ups offer incremental changes, but what if you had a moon- shot
                                        innovation for a problem the world has ceased to consider as one. Or a
                                        problem considered solved? <br><br>
                                        Moonshots, by their very definition, need to be hurtled until something big
                                        is identified. The innovation after that identification might take time, in
                                        some cases, a very long time. (Would you not say that the problem you are
                                        addressing is a blind spot- that the best in chatting-productivity has been
                                        achieved and that is just the start of the moon shot you must make to
                                        disrupt existing models of education?)

                                        So, my challenge is to manifest a never-before vision into a
                                        finger-licking good looking product that elicits a collective gasp of
                                        “why did we not see that earlier”, from the world. <br><br>
                                        (To those who repeat the trite Form Follows Function rule, let me quote
                                        just one example- Snapchat, that turned that norm on its head. It was a
                                        beautiful but tedious product to begin with. It bettered itself over
                                        time) <br><br>
                                        Money, of course- now. <br><br>
                                        Traction, not just yet. <br><br>
                                        I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing
                                        traction instead of a chasing a world changing vision which did not fit the bill
                                        for the rule of - build MVP - followed by traction, before I could raise money.

    This is stuff made of dreams. Once upon a time, there was a dream Nishchal had nurtured as a mere drawing for a new kind of a social network on his chart papers, backed with $100,000 worth of investments in 2009. Thereafter, Parag was among the first people to have joined Nishchal to build their first company in 2009. At that time Parag had just graduated from IIT Delhi. Nishchal is still on it, and Parag is just a call away. <br><br> Nishchal & Parag have shared a great relationship over the last 10 years while Nishchal was in the Himalayas and Parag was in San Francisco. They remain in touch to this day and exchange a great amount of knowledge about technology and startups globally.

                    Dear distribution artists, <br>
                    I understand what goes into putting marketing strategies for viral distribution of the web products.
                    It is more of an art than app designing is. <br>
                    Lets first discuss that part of the marketing that is about acquiring users only: <br>
                    <br>
                    We need 1 extra ordinary marketer who could -: <br>
                    1. 100% organic marketing. We mean it. There will be no money for promotions (even if money is not a
                    problem for us) for marketing at this stage of startups at Preseed Projects. So you got to know the
                    hacks of the web marketing and distribution world. <br>
                    2. Have faith that this job is the key to helping some really inspired founders and developers in
                    changing the world. <br>
                    You need to be well networked in the global tech media community and should be active on Hacker
                    News, redditt, Twitter, Product Hunt, relevant media and other popular platforms that can be mighty
                    useful to create an initial buzz. You need to be our exact definition of a new age web hustler. This
                    guy should communicate like a bullet. <br>
                    If you are this guy, write to me at <a href="mailto:nishchal@preseed.in">nishchal@preseed.in</a>
                    with the subject 'Preseed Project marketer'.
                    If I like you, I would offer you a fair stake in Preseed itself for you are important to my scheme
                    of things. <br>

                        <strong>INTRODUCTION TO DAILY UPDATES PROCESS/protocol AT PRESEED STARTUPS </strong>
                        <br> <br>
                        Welcome to Preseed, where <br> <br>
                        WE INSPIRE <br> <br>
                        IDEAS I FAITH I ACTION <br> <br>
                        Your decision to join Preseed is very inspirational and it clearly indicates your faith in
                        Preseed culture.
                        Here you not only get to perform at the highest level as an individual but you also have a
                        strong team support. Apart from the tasks assigned to you, one of the most important protocols
                        to act upon is the #daily-updates.
                        Every morning, you have to update about your day to be, meaning the tasks you will perform
                        during the day.
                        <br> <br>

                        At the end of the day you will need to update again on the tasks completed or worked upon and
                        the status of it. this flow of communication will happen via #daily-updates channel on your
                        startup's slack community.
                        <br> <br>

                        Length of your updates can be as small as you like. Daily update should not be looked as a
                        botheration to anyone. It should be seen as a macro implication.
                        <br> <br>

                        The daily updates become a reference point of work for the next day.

                        <br> <br>

                        Imagine Preseed to be operating in a physical work space. Every morning you come to the office.
                        The day begins with a 10 am meeting ritual with the captain. You discuss your daily activities
                        and your day to be. Daily updates help Nishchal keep one individual's work well co ordinated
                        with the 20 others , that collectively impact Preseed. Directly or indirectly. It also gives him
                        a sense of daily activities in our organization. So update daily, regardless. The captain has to
                        know at all times what his team is working on every single day.
                        Daily update is just an unbiased update about whatever one did that day / the previous day, in
                        brief. Planning is definitely important and worthy of an update.
                        The daily update just needs to be a brief update strictly for a layman; when looking at the
                        daily updates day by day, that lay man should feel there is progress.
                        Hurry up. Join Slack. Start Updating!

                        <h3>
                            Minutes Protocol
                        </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Name of members
                            </li>
                            <li> Subject of meeting</li>
                            <li> Skype/hangouts/facetime/etc or in person?</li>
                            <li> Date must be recorded and in the title of the doc</li>
                            <li> Make and share a google doc with your relevant coordinators</li>
                            <li> Minutes should be written down in bullets and no point is to be missed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        Minutes document would contain the agenda(s) of the meeting as bullets and the discussion which
                        took place for each agenda should be written down in sub bullets.
                        <br><br>
                        For example Extract of one of the one of the call MyIdeaList team meeting ,
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Daily Updates (one of our agenda agenda)</li>
                            <li>A asked team why were they not giving daily updates but B and C had no answer. A asked
                                them to ensure they give daily updates.</li>
                            <li>Even if you guys do nothing please, do not mind posting that you have done nothing.</li>
                            <li>Also what we can share what all we did today? something exciting?</li>
                            (all three are the brief of the discussion which took place regarding the agenda)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <strong>
                            The Minutes of Meeting that is done among two or more team members need to be recorded and
                            shared within 24 hours so that there is speed with transparency to fuel our progress. I
                            think the idea of the Minutes are pretty clear but the following are some guidelines.

                        </strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Minutes will be shared in relevant fb workgroups, not emails unless specified. If you remember
                        my last post about minutes here. I clearly specified its got to be in the workgroup. <br><br>
                        However, the conclusion from the minutes would go into relevant spreadsheets. <br><br>
                        For Example; So when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thind.aman">Aman Thind</a> shares the
                        minute here the coordinators will take the relevant elements the right folder. <br><br>
                        Nishchal and coordinators, keep themselves tuned with activities across Preseed through
                        following them on slack channels, through the cc: coordinator@preseed.in , and through minutes
                        on google doc of your significant interactions on other mediums of communication. So sharing
                        minutes doc is so important.

            How are teams built? - Other team members' contribution to finding new talents for their team is paramount.
            Each one should take upon themselves in growing their teams. <br> So I am clearly saying if you talent around you
            with counter culture beliefs that resonate with Preseed values, create introductions of such people with us,
          <br>  along with your views on what agenda could we build upon with the fellow being you have found for us. <br>
            Delegation of work - MOST IMPORTANT Everyone must learn over a period of time of course, 'the art of
            building their own team'. <br> The biggest attribute we see in our people is 'how well can they inspire others to
            work with them' if you need money to build your team then you need to see how Nishchal is building his team.
