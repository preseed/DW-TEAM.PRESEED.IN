                                <span>After I failed in building my first consumer web product in 2010 with a near
                                    $100,000 in investment. I decided to be that guy who the whimsical hackers and
                                    designers were willing to lend their ears and skills to, regardless of the
                                    compensation I was going to pay them, <b> for now there was going to be no
                                        money</b>, but
                                    yet the same journey filled with <b> ideas, conviction and inspiration</b>. For I
                                    always had
                                    ideas, conviction and inspiration (right from my college days) that if coupled with
                                    the skills of hackers and designers can translate into very meaningful web products
                                    of great value to the users.</span>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To be that guy I had to be Preseed Web Lab, and for Preseed Web Lab to exist, there had
                                to be <a href="https://preseed.in/">Preseed</a> .
                                <br><br>
                                So after 1 year of starting Preseed in 2012. I am finally at a place —

                                <br><br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>Where I have been able to attract a hand full of hand picked hackers and
                                            designers I have now started to develop upon some cool app ideas with at
                                            Preseed Web Lab with a substantial share of the products with Preseed.</b>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>While every other secondary aspects of Preseed vis a vis Preseed Ecell, Preseed
                                        Anything Lab etc. is now handled by a bunch of other people who are inspired
                                        enough to build the culture of Preseed with or with out me. Hence, all I got to
                                        do with them is show them the path forward and guide them through a little each
                                        day. Which leaves me enough time to put a near 8 hours in a day into Preseed Web
                                        Lab, the primary aspect of Preseed.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Where I have men who keep sharing with us the new age web tools, articles,
                                        products my team seeks to know about.</li>
                                    <li>Where I can continue to live liberally as an artist and so can my team.
                                    </li>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Note-: Our market is not the users of the end products we are making. Our market is
                                    the counter cultured hackers, hustlers and designers we want to build stuff with. As
                                    long as we get 30 such hackers and hustlers registered with Preseed Web Lab in the
                                    next 2 years , we are good.
                                    <br><br> Out of 30 such hackers, hustlers and designers we identify, we believe
                                    atleast one team of 3 would have us build one great product.
                                </ol>

                                The most exciting learning moment of it all was 'how to build an ego less
                                company' - What does that even mean? It means a company without any door or
                                roof or body or shape. No, ego less company is not a word that has been used
                                ever perhaps, I coined it to explain yet another fundamentally different
                                attribute of our company. The advantage of running a company like this is
                                that I don't have to waste too much time in hiring or firing people, people
                                can come in freely and walk out freely. THE GOODNESS OF THIS STRATEGY LIES
                                IN THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO COME IN AND DON'T LEAVE.

                            <br><br> I put the first word about Preseed in feb of 2012. Since then we have
                            come a
                            long way forward. From no money in my pocket and 1 person to no money in my
                            pocket and 15+ people team. That means a lot of things, but this post is not
                            about what all that could means, since, all that I have already indicated
                            across my various writings about Preseed. This post is to describe how I
                            plan to distribute stocks to employees of Preseed <br><br>

                                of
                                ideas, faith and action through irreplaceable inspiration.

                            One of the greatest difficulties that I face in running a company like
                            Preseed in the world of people who have much greater egos than their
                            knowledge (obviously, for, ego and knowledge are inversely proportional) is
                            handling people with my little tolerance to bull shit excuses, careless
                            attitude towards my company and mediocrity. Oftentimes their inflated egos
                            make them want to quit immediately after that rare outburst from me. <br><br>
                            Well obviously there is a good in even that event of that person leaving,
                            the problem is the going also creates that negative vibe in the company
                            because the company of individuals does not understand that coming and going
                            is no big deal in a liberal culture like that <br><br>
                            One needs to understand that if I pasted them they must have deserved it.
                            Any way startup life is not so rosy and even the rose comes with thorns. If
                            you can keep taking those blows and keep moving forward for the sake of our
                            mission, then you most definitely deserve a chance not only to hold the
                            stock but to lead one day for you listened well from those whose sincerity
                            in Preseed is unquestionable. You need to understand that if I pasted you, I
                            did it in the best interest of our company which is one thing you can’t
                            doubt. Try it. <br><br>
                            For me the best interest of preseed matters far over and above pleasing
                            anyone. I am easy but those who are careless may not find me that easy after
                            all. Find out about the strictness of Sri Yukteswara’s attributes as a
                            teacher to Sri Yogananda Parhamansa and Steve Jobs/Elon Musk/Larry Page’s

                            For ego stock post — 
                            <br><br>
                            I don’t know about 2015 but I know if in 2014 I am doing anything that does not
                            relate to Todoed then it is not the right way to go for me. I am saying that I
                            have brought Preseed to a point where as long as it has you guys hustling
                            together it will keep moving forward as long as each one has the intent to be
                            there for each other. As long as that is there we have a structure and spirit to
                            build an extraordinary company out of such relations we are forging. <br> <br>
                            Anyway, so I am saying that please run the company smoothly so smoothly that I
                            don’t have to interfere. <br> <br>
                            If I am found doing anything else in the company other that building Chattodo
                            then know without me saying,that you guys are not doing it right. I need to
                            focus only on Chattodo. For everything else I have laid the foundation very
                            thoughtfully in such a way that it can all be handled with my continued
                            directions which will always be there, especially given that I have already
                            written everything in detail all the way to the next 5 years of our works
                            forward. Now we just have to fill the dots most of which are already indicated.
                            Basically, I feel the blueprint is already created. Now we have to see how well
                            you guys collaborate among each other and cooperate with each other. Just
                            remember it is important to empathize with those you work with to truly
                            understand their situations and intent at all times. That will help you make
                            right and righteous decisions for each one of us. <br> <br>
                            Please work hard. Preseed will not only be a mulit billion-dollar company but
                            will also be a company that will inspire generations through truth and
                            unparalleled transparency.

                            <br><br>

                            Nishchal is here to sincerely help change your status quo, to ensure that you get at
                            least one shot to
                            do something impactfully different. His attributes are as different as the result he
                            wants to create,
                            even culturally. Some of those attributes of his we love while some others find
                            amusing:
                            <br><br>

                            1) He rides bicycles and shows up for most 
				ings(and parties) in shorts and
                            t-shirts, needless to
                            say, sweaty and muddy. He doesn’t care about what he is wearing and he also doesn’t
                            care about what
                            you are wearing.
                            <br><br>
                            2) He has huge concerns over effective visual communications, especially if you are
                            designing to
                            communicate with your customers for customers won't get into long verbose
                            conversations with you. He
                            feels if you invest on communications right, it would really facilitate his task of
                            ‘GROWING THE
                            COMPANY’. If you are an alive company with some real on the ground traction,
                            sometimes, the first
                            job he may want to get done for you is getting this aspect of your business right.
                            We hope we will
                            find you prepared to invest time and money on this.
                            <br><br>
                            Note -: Good designs seek good payments. If you are not willing to pay the graphic
                            designers well,
                            we won’t take the responsibility of your visual communications. Actually this stands
                            true for any
                            vendor services.
                            <br><br>
                            3) He may get really really profound and verbose at times, almost on a whim, but
                            that's because he
                            has a very liberated sense of possibilities, passion backed with logics that may
                            take you time to
                            comprehend just like most groundbreaking logics in physics may take time to
                            comprehend.
                            <br><br>

                            4) He is even further north of the optimistic side, from other people’s perspectives
                            (especially those
                            who are still found conducting business in traditional ways*). HE IS REALLY REALLY
                            DREAMY, YET SIMPLE.

                            <br><br>
                            5) He never thinks not backed by an investor is a problem or a big deal, so you also
                            please stop
                            assuming that it is. It definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it
                            should not mean
                            you stop the hustle. Be creative in even how you make your ends meet. <i>Where there
                                is a will there
                                is a way</i>. Look carefully at how he is trying to do the same for himself.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Traditional ways :-</b><br><br>
                            A) Poor visual communication.
                            <br>
                            B) Without harnessing the internet.
                            <br>
                            C) Unclearly defined roles and responsibilities of the staff.
                            <br>
                            D) Uninspired management apart from the co-owners.
                            <br>
                            E) No Business plan.
                            <br>
                            F) Ineffective or delegation of tasks.
                            <br>
                            G) Unoptimized resource including the available human resource.
                            <br>
                            H) Little or no funding.
                            <br>
                            I) Disbelief and bad payments against exceptional quality.

                            <br><br>
                            At PRESEED YOGA these are also some of the aspects we work on.<br><br>
                            5) He never thinks money is a problem or a big deal, so you also please stop
                            assuming that it is. It
                            definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it should not mean you
                            stop the hustle.
                            <br><br>
                            6) He will say a point once and in most cases, it would be communicated to you in
                            written words. We
                            already assume that you are inspired enough to take action on the point he has
                            stated. So, don’t
                            expect us to send reminders or follow up till you yourself write to us telling us
                            the status of
                            whatever the point of concern was. He hates to repeat. It's not an ego thing. It's
                            the ‘duplication
                            of the same effort’ that he is against. It is the same as inefficiency.
                            <br><br>
                            7) Twitter is one of the best ways to get in touch with him. He prefer it over
                            emails and phone
                            calls.
                            <br><br>
                            8) We hate to see his time getting wasted with you. You are not the only
                            business/idea/goal/dream he
                            is dealing with. So, please value his time. Value your time too. If you save him
                            time, he will most
                            certainly make this world a better place.
                            <br><br>
                            9) He is critical(but not over critical) and brutally honest. In fact so much that
                            sometimes we lose
                            people for they get offended. But, that helps us in filtering bozos. We just hope
                            you are not one of
                            them who we lose.
                            <br><br>
                            10) If you are not being creative and liberal, we are not interested in you.
                        </p>

The only thing that would satisfy him is the answer to why he exist, not intellectual but experiential. He did his post-graduation in TQM, but his heart and soul were solving the puzzle of life. In the end utter frustration and complete hopelessness makes his Guru decent upon him and open certain doors of existence. This was his second birth and henceforth he started expressing himself and doing lot of projects. From providing cure to chronic ailment, mental health, deaddiction, core capability enhancement, establishing the missing aspect in education. Basically, discovering and implementing tools and techniques of empowerment to the mankind.</span><br><br><br><br>

                        Dear distribution artists, <br>
                        I understand what goes into putting marketing strategies for viral distribution of the
                        web
                        products.
                        It is more of an art than app designing is. <br>
                        Lets first discuss that part of the marketing that is about acquiring users only: <br>
                        <br>
                        We need 1 extra ordinary marketer who could -: <br>
                        1. 100% organic marketing. We mean it. There will be no money for promotions (even if
                        money
                        is
                        not a
                        problem for us) for marketing at this stage of startups at Preseed Projects. So you got
                        to
                        know

                        hacks of the web marketing and distribution world. <br>
                        2. Have faith that this job is the key to helping some really inspired founders and
                        developers
                        in
                        changing the world. <br>
                        You need to be well networked in the global tech media community and should be active on
                        Hacker
                        News, redditt, Twitter, Product Hunt, relevant media and other popular platforms that
                        can be
                        mighty
                        useful to create an initial buzz. You need to be our exact definition of a new age web
                        hustler.

                        We value simplicity - in our world we pride ourselves on our design aesthetics. This
                        opening
                        is
                        not for anyone who feel their vibes flow strong with ours, unless you are someone with a
                        subtle
                        design sensibility and leadership fire to inspire a team of designers. Over the past few
                        years
                        we have learned that designers in themselves are a very different type of leader - one
                        we
                        would
                        need to balance out the Reactor Core. There are countless projects related to design
                        going
                        on in
                        Preseed and your role would require you to have hawkeyes over them along with the team
                        of

                        someone
                        in the team, but before that - apply.</span><br>

                        <strong>Partner the geeks and hustlers and create marketable products by
                            design.</strong>
                        This is where extraordinary front end men and women look after those aspects of the
                        product
                        that the users will interact with. This is the team that finally makes Preseed products
                        marketable by design. <br><br>
                        This stage for Preseed typically starts when the initial idea is prototyped into a MVP
                        and
                        now it is time for it to start interacting with the users. <br><br>
                        Now let me elaborate a very important remark I just made, ‘ The team that makes products
                        marketable by design’, through the eyes of Preseed -: <br><br>
                        Step 1 — We get the geeks to hear our ideas, get inspired, code and deliver the MVP of
                        the
                        idea discussed. Until this point they handle the front end as hackers not as designers.
                        This
                        works to speedily get prototypes ready for our testing, may be sometimes even private
                        beta
                        launch because ‘we like to launch fast, even if the design is rather embarrassing’.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="./img/reid.png" alt="" class="img img-responsive">
                        <br><br>
                        Step 2 — The MVP is now ready for the play. Remember it is still not the best UI even
                        though
                        we can imagine it, for we don’t think we want to spend our resources to create the best
                        UI
                        for it yet, for it first needs to be launched to the real users. So once the MVP is
                        tested
                        privately, we open the exact same thing for the users, and then continue iterating till
                        we
                        see some customer traction <br><br>
                        Step 3 — This is when you come in. At this stage we have some real customer metrics.
                        This is
                        really when an idea starts looking like it is ready and worthy of more resources. The
                        MVP
                        now has a hand full of users using it, while it had designs that were not the kinds we
                        would
                        like to see in products we use as users. So clearly it is a good sign that the product
                        is
                        making sense even though it is not well designed. <br><br>
                        Step 4 — Marketing through design. Do you know what we mean? This is when the products
                        are
                        brought to the team at Ugly MVP. This is when Preseed Web Lab finds its front end
                        artists.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 5 — Once we have created a UI that work, we start distributing the product, through
                        media, popular bloggers, relevant forums, early adopters, distribution apps etc.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 6 — We keep trying till we either fail or we succeed. <br><br>
                        Step 7 — We move on to our next product. <br><br>
                        Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems
                        we
                        see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong
                        engineers. It’s a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web ‘design’
                        sensibilities. The reason stands — lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool
                        people.
                        We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products. <br><br>
                        For now we are looking for just 1 user interaction designer who is willing to commit
                        themselves to Preseed and its products/startups/clients. We won’t pay these designers
                        any
                        salary or immediate compensation. We will instead offer the designers upto 2% ownership
                        in
                        Preseed soon enough perhaps immediately after 3 months of our active working
                        relationship.

                        Note -: Preseed is going to command substantial ownerships in a lot of future startups.
                        Even
                        1% ownership at Preseed may be of a huge monetary value someday. <br><br>

    This is stuff made of dreams. Once upon a time, there was a dream Nishchal had nurtured as a mere drawing for a new kind of a social network on his chart papers, backed with $100,000 worth of investments in 2009. Thereafter, Parag was among the first people to have joined Nishchal to build their first company in 2009. At that time Parag had just graduated from IIT Delhi. Nishchal is still on it, and Parag is just a call away. <br><br> Nishchal & Parag have shared a great relationship over the last 10 years while Nishchal was in the Himalayas and Parag was in San Francisco. They remain in touch to this day and exchange a great amount of knowledge about technology and startups globally.

                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                        <br>
                        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                        And having perhaps the better claim<br>
                        Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br>
                        Though as for that the passing there<br>
                        Had worn them really about the same,<br>
                        <br>
                        And both that morning equally lay<br>
                        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                        Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br>
                        I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
                        <br>
                        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
                        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br>
                        I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                        And that has made all the difference.<br>

                <strong>INTRODUCTION TO DAILY UPDATES PROCESS/protocol AT PRESEED STARTUPS </strong>
                <br> <br>
                Welcome to Preseed, where <br> <br>
                WE INSPIRE <br> <br>
                IDEAS I FAITH I ACTION <br> <br>
                Your decision to join Preseed is very inspirational and it clearly indicates your faith in
                Preseed culture.
                Here you not only get to perform at the highest level as an individual but you also have a
                strong team support. Apart from the tasks assigned to you, one of the most important
                protocols
                to act upon is the #daily-updates.
                Every morning, you have to update about your day to be, meaning the tasks you will perform
                during the day.
                <br> <br>

                At the end of the day you will need to update again on the tasks completed or worked upon
                and
                the status of it. this flow of communication will happen via #daily-updates channel on your
                startup's slack community.
                <br> <br>

                Length of your updates can be as small as you like. Daily update should not be looked as a
                botheration to anyone. It should be seen as a macro implication.
                <br> <br>

                The daily updates become a reference point of work for the next day.

                <br> <br>

                Imagine Preseed to be operating in a physical work space. Every morning you come to the
                office.
                The day begins with a 10 am meeting ritual with the captain. You discuss your daily
                activities
                and your day to be. Daily updates help Guruji keep one individual's work well co ordinated
                with the 20 others , that collectively impact Preseed. Directly or indirectly. It also gives
                him
                a sense of daily activities in our organization. So update daily, regardless. The captain
                has to
                know at all times what his team is working on every single day.
                Daily update is just an unbiased update about whatever one did that day / the previous day,
                in
                brief. Planning is definitely important and worthy of an update.
                The daily update just needs to be a brief update strictly for a layman; when looking at the
                daily updates day by day, that lay man should feel there is progress.
                Hurry up. Join Slack. Start Updating!

                <h3>
                    Minutes Protocol
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Name of members
                    </li>
                    <li> Subject of meeting</li>
                    <li> Skype/hangouts/facetime/etc or in person?</li>
                    <li> Date must be recorded and in the title of the doc</li>
                    <li> Make and share a google doc with your relevant coordinators</li>
                    <li> Minutes should be written down in bullets and no point is to be missed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                Minutes document would contain the agenda(s) of the meeting as bullets and the discussion
                which
                took place for each agenda should be written down in sub bullets.
                <br><br>
                For example Extract of one of the one of the call MyIdeaList team meeting ,
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Daily Updates (one of our agenda agenda)</li>
                    <li>A asked team why were they not giving daily updates but B and C had no answer. A
                        asked
                        them to ensure they give daily updates.</li>
                    <li>Even if you guys do nothing please, do not mind posting that you have done nothing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Also what we can share what all we did today? something exciting?</li>
                    (all three are the brief of the discussion which took place regarding the agenda)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>
                    The Minutes of Meeting that is done among two or more team members need to be recorded
                    and
                    shared within 24 hours so that there is speed with transparency to fuel our progress. I
                    think the idea of the Minutes are pretty clear but the following are some guidelines.

                </strong>
                <br><br>
                Minutes will be shared in relevant fb workgroups, not emails unless specified. If you
                remember
                my last post about minutes here. I clearly specified its got to be in the workgroup.
                <br><br>
                However, the conclusion from the minutes would go into relevant spreadsheets. <br><br>
                For Example; So when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thind.aman">Aman Thind</a> shares the
                minute here the coordinators will take the relevant elements the right folder. <br><br>
                Guruji and coordinators, keep themselves tuned with activities across Preseed through
                following them on slack channels, through the cc: coordinator@preseed.in , and through
                minutes
                on google doc of your significant interactions on other mediums of communication. So sharing
                minutes doc is so important.

                    Eventually your soul tribe will appear, do not fear the process of solitude.
