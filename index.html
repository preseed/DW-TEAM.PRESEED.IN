                                <span>After I failed in building my first consumer web product in 2010 with a near
                                    $100,000 in investment. I decided to be that guy who the whimsical hackers and
                                    designers were willing to lend their ears and skills to, regardless of the
                                    compensation I was going to pay them, <b> for now there was going to be no
                                        money</b>, but
                                    yet the same journey filled with <b> ideas, conviction and inspiration</b>. For I
                                    always had
                                    ideas, conviction and inspiration (right from my college days) that if coupled with
                                    the skills of hackers and designers can translate into very meaningful web products
                                    of great value to the users.</span>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To be that guy I had to be Preseed Web Lab, and for Preseed Web Lab to exist, there had
                                to be <a href="https://preseed.in/">Preseed</a> .
                                <br><br>
                                So after 1 year of starting Preseed in 2012. I am finally at a place —

                                <br><br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>Where I have been able to attract a hand full of hand picked hackers and
                                            designers I have now started to develop upon some cool app ideas with at
                                            Preseed Web Lab with a substantial share of the products with Preseed.</b>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>While every other secondary aspects of Preseed vis a vis Preseed Ecell, Preseed
                                        Anything Lab etc. is now handled by a bunch of other people who are inspired
                                        enough to build the culture of Preseed with or with out me. Hence, all I got to
                                        do with them is show them the path forward and guide them through a little each
                                        day. Which leaves me enough time to put a near 8 hours in a day into Preseed Web
                                        Lab, the primary aspect of Preseed.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Where I have men who keep sharing with us the new age web tools, articles,
                                        products my team seeks to know about.</li>
                                    <li>Where I can continue to live liberally as an artist and so can my team.
                                    </li>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Note-: Our market is not the users of the end products we are making. Our market is
                                    the counter cultured hackers, hustlers and designers we want to build stuff with. As
                                    long as we get 30 such hackers and hustlers registered with Preseed Web Lab in the
                                    next 2 years , we are good.
                                    <br><br> Out of 30 such hackers, hustlers and designers we identify, we believe
                                    atleast one team of 3 would have us build one great product.
                                </ol>

                                roof or body or shape. No, ego less company is not a word that has been used
                                ever perhaps, I coined it to explain yet another fundamentally different
                                attribute of our company. The advantage of running a company like this is
                                that I don't have to waste too much time in hiring or firing people, people
                                can come in freely and walk out freely. THE GOODNESS OF THIS STRATEGY LIES
                                IN THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO COME IN AND DON'T LEAVE.

                            <br><br> I put the first word about Preseed in feb of 2012. Since then we have
                            come a
                            long way forward. From no money in my pocket and 1 person to no money in my
                            pocket and 15+ people team. That means a lot of things, but this post is not
                            about what all that could means, since, all that I have already indicated
                            across my various writings about Preseed. This post is to describe how I
                            plan to distribute stocks to employees of Preseed <br><br>

                            One of the greatest difficulties that I face in running a company like
                            Preseed in the world of people who have much greater egos than their
                            knowledge (obviously, for, ego and knowledge are inversely proportional) is
                            handling people with my little tolerance to bull shit excuses, careless
                            attitude towards my company and mediocrity. Oftentimes their inflated egos
                            make them want to quit immediately after that rare outburst from me. <br><br>
                            Well obviously there is a good in even that event of that person leaving,
                            the problem is the going also creates that negative vibe in the company
                            because the company of individuals does not understand that coming and going
                            is no big deal in a liberal culture like that <br><br>
                            One needs to understand that if I pasted them they must have deserved it.
                            Any way startup life is not so rosy and even the rose comes with thorns. If
                            you can keep taking those blows and keep moving forward for the sake of our
                            mission, then you most definitely deserve a chance not only to hold the
                            stock but to lead one day for you listened well from those whose sincerity
                            in Preseed is unquestionable. You need to understand that if I pasted you, I
                            did it in the best interest of our company which is one thing you can’t
                            doubt. Try it. <br><br>
                            For me the best interest of preseed matters far over and above pleasing
                            anyone. I am easy but those who are careless may not find me that easy after
                            all. Find out about the strictness of Sri Yukteswara’s attributes as a
                            teacher to Sri Yogananda Parhamansa and Steve Jobs/Elon Musk/Larry Page’s
                            strictness as leaders of their teams. <br><br>

                            For ego stock post — 
                            <br><br>
                            I don’t know about 2015 but I know if in 2014 I am doing anything that does not
                            relate to Todoed then it is not the right way to go for me. I am saying that I
                            have brought Preseed to a point where as long as it has you guys hustling
                            together it will keep moving forward as long as each one has the intent to be
                            there for each other. As long as that is there we have a structure and spirit to
                            build an extraordinary company out of such relations we are forging. <br> <br>
                            Anyway, so I am saying that please run the company smoothly so smoothly that I
                            don’t have to interfere. <br> <br>
                            If I am found doing anything else in the company other that building Chattodo
                            then know without me saying,that you guys are not doing it right. I need to
                            focus only on Chattodo. For everything else I have laid the foundation very
                            thoughtfully in such a way that it can all be handled with my continued
                            directions which will always be there, especially given that I have already
                            written everything in detail all the way to the next 5 years of our works
                            forward. Now we just have to fill the dots most of which are already indicated.
                            Basically, I feel the blueprint is already created. Now we have to see how well
                            you guys collaborate among each other and cooperate with each other. Just
                            remember it is important to empathize with those you work with to truly
                            understand their situations and intent at all times. That will help you make
                            right and righteous decisions for each one of us. <br> <br>
                            Please work hard. Preseed will not only be a mulit billion-dollar company but
                            will also be a company that will inspire generations through truth and
                            unparalleled transparency.

                            <center>
                                <img src="./img/nshorts.jpeg" alt="" class="img img-responsive">

                            </center>
                            <br><br>

                            Guruji is here to sincerely help change your status quo, to ensure that you get at
                            least one shot to
                            do something impactfully different. His attributes are as different as the result he
                            wants to create,
                            even culturally. Some of those attributes of his we love while some others find
                            amusing:
                            <br><br>

                            1) He rides bicycles and shows up for most 
				ings(and parties) in shorts and
                            t-shirts, needless to
                            say, sweaty and muddy. He doesn’t care about what he is wearing and he also doesn’t
                            care about what
                            you are wearing.
                            <br><br>
                            2) He has huge concerns over effective visual communications, especially if you are
                            designing to
                            communicate with your customers for customers won't get into long verbose
                            conversations with you. He
                            feels if you invest on communications right, it would really facilitate his task of
                            ‘GROWING THE
                            COMPANY’. If you are an alive company with some real on the ground traction,
                            sometimes, the first
                            job he may want to get done for you is getting this aspect of your business right.
                            We hope we will
                            find you prepared to invest time and money on this.
                            <br><br>
                            Note -: Good designs seek good payments. If you are not willing to pay the graphic
                            designers well,
                            we won’t take the responsibility of your visual communications. Actually this stands
                            true for any
                            vendor services.
                            <br><br>
                            3) He may get really really profound and verbose at times, almost on a whim, but
                            that's because he
                            has a very liberated sense of possibilities, passion backed with logics that may
                            take you time to
                            comprehend just like most groundbreaking logics in physics may take time to
                            comprehend.
                            <br><br>

                            4) He is even further north of the optimistic side, from other people’s perspectives
                            (especially those
                            who are still found conducting business in traditional ways*). HE IS REALLY REALLY
                            DREAMY, YET SIMPLE.

                            <br><br>
                            5) He never thinks not backed by an investor is a problem or a big deal, so you also
                            please stop
                            assuming that it is. It definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it
                            should not mean
                            you stop the hustle. Be creative in even how you make your ends meet. <i>Where there
                                is a will there
                                is a way</i>. Look carefully at how he is trying to do the same for himself.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Traditional ways :-</b><br><br>
                            A) Poor visual communication.
                            <br>
                            B) Without harnessing the internet.
                            <br>
                            C) Unclearly defined roles and responsibilities of the staff.
                            <br>
                            D) Uninspired management apart from the co-owners.
                            <br>
                            E) No Business plan.
                            <br>
                            F) Ineffective or delegation of tasks.
                            <br>
                            G) Unoptimized resource including the available human resource.
                            <br>
                            H) Little or no funding.
                            <br>
                            I) Disbelief and bad payments against exceptional quality.

                            <br><br>
                            At PRESEED YOGA these are also some of the aspects we work on.<br><br>
                            5) He never thinks money is a problem or a big deal, so you also please stop
                            assuming that it is. It
                            definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it should not mean you
                            stop the hustle.
                            <br><br>
                            6) He will say a point once and in most cases, it would be communicated to you in
                            written words. We
                            already assume that you are inspired enough to take action on the point he has
                            stated. So, don’t
                            expect us to send reminders or follow up till you yourself write to us telling us
                            the status of
                            whatever the point of concern was. He hates to repeat. It's not an ego thing. It's
                            the ‘duplication
                            of the same effort’ that he is against. It is the same as inefficiency.
                            <br><br>
                            7) Twitter is one of the best ways to get in touch with him. He prefer it over
                            emails and phone
                            calls.
                            <br><br>
                            8) We hate to see his time getting wasted with you. You are not the only
                            business/idea/goal/dream he
                            is dealing with. So, please value his time. Value your time too. If you save him
                            time, he will most
                            certainly make this world a better place.
                            <br><br>
                            9) He is critical(but not over critical) and brutally honest. In fact so much that
                            sometimes we lose
                            people for they get offended. But, that helps us in filtering bozos. We just hope
                            you are not one of
                            them who we lose.
                            <br><br>
                            10) If you are not being creative and liberal, we are not interested in you.
                        </p>

The only thing that would satisfy him is the answer to why he exist, not intellectual but experiential. He did his post-graduation in TQM, but his heart and soul were solving the puzzle of life. In the end utter frustration and complete hopelessness makes his Guru decent upon him and open certain doors of existence. This was his second birth and henceforth he started expressing himself and doing lot of projects. From providing cure to chronic ailment, mental health, deaddiction, core capability enhancement, establishing the missing aspect in education. Basically, discovering and implementing tools and techniques of empowerment to the mankind.</span><br><br><br><br>

                    We need money now
                    to get to the launch ready version.
                    The app has not been publically launched and hence, has traction in only double figures.
                    Therefore, there has been no need for us yet to have dabbled in cost or revenue
                    projections.

                    <br>
                    I bring to YOU our need for a minimum of $200,000 to build a <strong>'launch

                    productivity tool as a
                    chat first
                    application for android as our first step towards this vision expressed as step 0 to step 2.
                    At
                    modest estimates, I
                    envision 1

                            Non-negotiable, for if you are investing in us you already feel there is a
                            potential of billions of dollars in value creation. $2.5 million today is
                            1/1000th
                            of that value creation potential.

                            same, but only in our absolute silence. The moment we start surfacing after
                            our
                            long silence, as individuals, we realize there is just one Sunny Kesarwani,
                            who
                            decided to say no to all opportunities where traction and team were a far
                            easier
                            find. I decided to chase a chat app instead, in spite of the world of
                            potential
                            colleagues that thought this won't work, because the world doesn't need

                            chat app. Let's understand that one of us out of millions of us can be
                            allowed
                            to break the rule of getting to an investor before traction, because he is
                            building a product that cannot come out as a MVP. Give me a minimum of
                            $200,000
                            absolutely
                            now and let me have my team full time. In three months we will build the
                            most
                            beautiful chat app in the world. Then give us the rest of money to launch it

                            the world.

                            as an investor, a man whose vibe I like, we may be willing to lower the

                            in 6 years. This will be too. By who? Facebook. Why? Facebook wants to be

                            1 in work collaboration space too, which we will win.

                        <i> We have developed the prototype, not the launch version of the app. Why? Like
                            we said above - just imagine, will you use a chatting app in 2017 which looks and feels
                            worse than Whatsapp, Slack, Snapchat or Fb messenger? We won't. So for us to make the
                            presence of our app felt, we must spend at least 100 thousand dollars to actually build
                            a finger licking beautiful product to launch it with the optimism that it will eat up
                            some of the market share of communication away from Whatsapp, FB messenger and Slack.
                            This implies that every waking hour of ours must go into the broad understanding of the
                            market, vision and team camaraderie first; then the development of the app, then the
                            launch of the app, and then following of metrics and somewhere along the way, dabbling
                            in projections will happen.

                            No traction yet for the main mobile app. Why? Why am I still pursuing investment when
                            there is not even a launch?
                            Because this product is about a chatapp. Chatting apps cannot be made and launched as
                            half baked MVPs for the world
                            We need investment to support the team so that our great team can continue to build a
                            great product with some confidence in the captain, that is I, that I will take care of
                            their bread and butter. Not everyone required in this team will have the same appetite
                            for risk as I.
                            Traction we have achieved so far: None. So far we were not chasing traction. We were
                            fighting personal odds and chasing a vision & design that required years of sacrifices
                            away from the norms of chasing traction common to apps with lesser time to chase vision,
                            because they are too busy chasing the incremental changes in the status quo.</i>

                        <br> <br>Peter Thiel became a billionaire by investing half a million dollars in Facebook
                        before
                        anyone else. Today he runs a fund which has invested in some of the world’s best startups.

                        Chattodo has a similar potential. You can be an investor in it by investing a half of what
                        Peter
                        Thiel did. This is a matter of a new kind of a social network.

                            <b> Why the standard question of traction may not be the most
                                appropriate question for a moonshot innovation in its nascent stage when
                                founders are seeking support from investors to continue their R&D
                                towards
                                launch?</b> <br><br>

                            For now, let's turn the lens on another kind of traction- which we have
                            already created- meaningful moments and activities noticed by users, media
                            and the tech community. <br><br>
                            I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing
                            traction instead of a chasing a world changing vision which did not fit the
                            bill for the rule of - build MVP - followed by traction, before I could
                            raise money. Please tell me how I would then change the world for the

                            Start-up land is littered with failure. <br><br>
                            Every hack on smart investing will preach that before approaching an
                            investor you must have dragged your feet over the thorns littered over that
                            holiest of grails- TRACTION. For after all what good is a business that does
                            not yield profits? Yet, if that critical question on TRACTION is duly asked
                            and answered before any investment, why the high rates of failure and a
                            subsequent celebration of failure as the norm in start-up land?
                            Could it be that the holy grail itself is flawed in a period where most of
                            our problems have been solved or are perceived to have been solved to an
                            acceptable degree beyond which improvements are not possible in a human,
                            hence imperfect world? <br><br>
                            I say YES. <br><br>
                            Most start-ups offer incremental changes, but what if you had a moon- shot
                            innovation for a problem the world has ceased to consider as one. Or a
                            problem considered solved? <br><br>
                            Moonshots, by their very definition, need to be hurtled until something big
                            is identified. The innovation after that identification might take time, in
                            some cases, a very long time. (Would you not say that the problem you are
                            addressing is a blind spot- that the best in chatting-productivity has been
                            achieved and that is just the start of the moon shot you must make to
                            disrupt existing models of education?)

                            for yet another chat app for people who were looking to be productive over
                            chats and the rest of the world did not agree with you.

                            Yes, you can’t code, don’t have the time to learn so you hire the best
                            to code for you. It must not surprise you that great people come at a
                            cost. Those great people may have had a life of their own before they
                            met a vision that I imparted to them and wished to be consumed by it but
                            for the mundane but real considerations of everyday living. <br><br>
                            More so, one requires neat sums of money for the world will not accept a
                            MVP that challenges its collective blind spot. <br><br>
                            So, my challenge is to manifest a never-before vision into a
                            finger-licking good looking product that elicits a collective gasp of
                            “why did we not see that earlier”, from the world. <br><br>
                            (To those who repeat the trite Form Follows Function rule, let me quote
                            just one example- Snapchat, that turned that norm on its head. It was a
                            beautiful but tedious product to begin with. It bettered itself over
                            time) <br><br>
                            Money, of course- now. <br><br>

                            focus
                            on that. That is the kind of start I want from my own marketing time spent.

                            So I build the product and pitch it to employees of top companies. That will

                            the highest use case of Chattodo I want to focus on that. And just that. It
                            entails, building a great product, and then talking to great people about
                            it.

                            Also writing to best media blogs in the world about it. I want the start of

                            I will stick to what I am good at, writing, I will write a thorough article

                        web
                        products.
                        It is more of an art than app designing is. <br>
                        Lets first discuss that part of the marketing that is about acquiring users only: <br>
                        <br>
                        We need 1 extra ordinary marketer who could -: <br>
                        1. 100% organic marketing. We mean it. There will be no money for promotions (even if
                        money
                        is
                        not a

                        You need to be well networked in the global tech media community and should be active on

                        now it is time for it to start interacting with the users. <br><br>
                        Now let me elaborate a very important remark I just made, ‘ The team that makes products
                        marketable by design’, through the eyes of Preseed -: <br><br>
                        Step 1 — We get the geeks to hear our ideas, get inspired, code and deliver the MVP of
                        the
                        idea discussed. Until this point they handle the front end as hackers not as designers.
                        This
                        works to speedily get prototypes ready for our testing, may be sometimes even private
                        beta
                        launch because ‘we like to launch fast, even if the design is rather embarrassing’.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="./img/reid.png" alt="" class="img img-responsive">
                        <br><br>
                        Step 2 — The MVP is now ready for the play. Remember it is still not the best UI even
                        though
                        we can imagine it, for we don’t think we want to spend our resources to create the best
                        UI
                        for it yet, for it first needs to be launched to the real users. So once the MVP is
                        tested
                        privately, we open the exact same thing for the users, and then continue iterating till
                        we
                        see some customer traction <br><br>
                        Step 3 — This is when you come in. At this stage we have some real customer metrics.
                        This is
                        really when an idea starts looking like it is ready and worthy of more resources. The
                        MVP
                        now has a hand full of users using it, while it had designs that were not the kinds we
                        would
                        like to see in products we use as users. So clearly it is a good sign that the product
                        is
                        making sense even though it is not well designed. <br><br>
                        Step 4 — Marketing through design. Do you know what we mean? This is when the products
                        are
                        brought to the team at Ugly MVP. This is when Preseed Web Lab finds its front end
                        artists.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 5 — Once we have created a UI that work, we start distributing the product, through
                        media, popular bloggers, relevant forums, early adopters, distribution apps etc.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 6 — We keep trying till we either fail or we succeed. <br><br>
                        Step 7 — We move on to our next product. <br><br>
                        Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems
                        we
                        see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong
                        engineers. It’s a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web ‘design’
                        sensibilities. The reason stands — lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool
                        people.
                        We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products. <br><br>
                        For now we are looking for just 1 user interaction designer who is willing to commit
                        themselves to Preseed and its products/startups/clients. We won’t pay these designers
                        any
                        salary or immediate compensation. We will instead offer the designers upto 2% ownership
                        in
                        Preseed soon enough perhaps immediately after 3 months of our active working
                        relationship.

    This is stuff made of dreams. Once upon a time, there was a dream Nishchal had nurtured as a mere drawing for a new kind of a social network on his chart papers, backed with $100,000 worth of investments in 2009. Thereafter, Parag was among the first people to have joined Nishchal to build their first company in 2009. At that time Parag had just graduated from IIT Delhi. Nishchal is still on it, and Parag is just a call away. <br><br> Nishchal & Parag have shared a great relationship over the last 10 years while Nishchal was in the Himalayas and Parag was in San Francisco. They remain in touch to this day and exchange a great amount of knowledge about technology and startups globally.

                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                        <br>
                        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                        And having perhaps the better claim<br>
                        Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br>
                        Though as for that the passing there<br>
                        Had worn them really about the same,<br>

                        And both that morning equally lay<br>
                        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                        Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br>
                        I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>

                        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>

                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br>
                        I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                        And that has made all the difference.<br>

                <strong>INTRODUCTION TO DAILY UPDATES PROCESS/protocol AT PRESEED STARTUPS </strong>
                <br> <br>
                Welcome to Preseed, where <br> <br>
                WE INSPIRE <br> <br>
                IDEAS I FAITH I ACTION <br> <br>
                Your decision to join Preseed is very inspirational and it clearly indicates your faith in
                Preseed culture.
                Here you not only get to perform at the highest level as an individual but you also have a
                strong team support. Apart from the tasks assigned to you, one of the most important
                protocols
                to act upon is the #daily-updates.
                Every morning, you have to update about your day to be, meaning the tasks you will perform
                during the day.
                <br> <br>

                At the end of the day you will need to update again on the tasks completed or worked upon
                and
                the status of it. this flow of communication will happen via #daily-updates channel on your
                startup's slack community.
                <br> <br>

                Length of your updates can be as small as you like. Daily update should not be looked as a
                botheration to anyone. It should be seen as a macro implication.
                <br> <br>

                The daily updates become a reference point of work for the next day.

                <br> <br>

                Imagine Preseed to be operating in a physical work space. Every morning you come to the
                office.
                The day begins with a 10 am meeting ritual with the captain. You discuss your daily
                activities
                and your day to be. Daily updates help Guruji keep one individual's work well co ordinated
                with the 20 others , that collectively impact Preseed. Directly or indirectly. It also gives
                him
                a sense of daily activities in our organization. So update daily, regardless. The captain
                has to
                know at all times what his team is working on every single day.
                Daily update is just an unbiased update about whatever one did that day / the previous day,
                in
                brief. Planning is definitely important and worthy of an update.
                The daily update just needs to be a brief update strictly for a layman; when looking at the
                daily updates day by day, that lay man should feel there is progress.
                Hurry up. Join Slack. Start Updating!

                    <li> Date must be recorded and in the title of the doc</li>
                    <li> Make and share a google doc with your relevant coordinators</li>
                    <li> Minutes should be written down in bullets and no point is to be missed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                Minutes document would contain the agenda(s) of the meeting as bullets and the discussion
                which
                took place for each agenda should be written down in sub bullets.
                <br><br>
                For example Extract of one of the one of the call MyIdeaList team meeting ,
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Daily Updates (one of our agenda agenda)</li>
                    <li>A asked team why were they not giving daily updates but B and C had no answer. A
                        asked
                        them to ensure they give daily updates.</li>
                    <li>Even if you guys do nothing please, do not mind posting that you have done nothing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Also what we can share what all we did today? something exciting?</li>
                    (all three are the brief of the discussion which took place regarding the agenda)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>
                    The Minutes of Meeting that is done among two or more team members need to be recorded
                    and
                    shared within 24 hours so that there is speed with transparency to fuel our progress. I
                    think the idea of the Minutes are pretty clear but the following are some guidelines.

                </strong>
                <br><br>
                Minutes will be shared in relevant fb workgroups, not emails unless specified. If you
                remember
                my last post about minutes here. I clearly specified its got to be in the workgroup.
                <br><br>
                However, the conclusion from the minutes would go into relevant spreadsheets. <br><br>
                For Example; So when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thind.aman">Aman Thind</a> shares the
                minute here the coordinators will take the relevant elements the right folder. <br><br>
                Guruji and coordinators, keep themselves tuned with activities across Preseed through
                following them on slack channels, through the cc: coordinator@preseed.in , and through
                minutes
                on google doc of your significant interactions on other mediums of communication. So sharing
                minutes doc is so important.

                How are teams built? - Other team members' contribution to finding new talents for their team is
                paramount.

                around you
                with counter culture beliefs that resonate with Preseed values, create introductions of such people with

                            The purpose of this protocol, is to ensure that every Preseed Team members’
                            communication is effective
                            and uniform so that we all follow certain protocols that define our
                            communications
                            well with each other.
                            Key here is to be fast and mindful. Empathise with other team members who you

                            learn from the conversation that takes place. Another reason is to be able to
                            amplify the reach of

                           1. First and most important protocol no excuse would be accepted for any low quality work. Maintain standards.
2. Communication at Light Speed. Team members must acknowledge and respond due diligently. Absolutely no failure in work will be tolerated due communication lag.
3. All hackers working on pages should setup repositories in their own github account. ie. they should host the pages while in development stage on their github account for exchanging opinions in the workgroup as screen shots don’t work.
4. All exchange of opinions on any design while the page is being worked upon should take place on the work group.
5. If any page has been finalized, same should be mentioned and the live page to be shared in the workgroup. ie. the page that is hosted on the person’s github account (the person who was assigned the task) to be shared here before calling it done. After the page has been approved only then it can be hosted on the preseed account.
6. When tasks are complete either on producteev of facebook workgroup update as done.
7. Any Documents made for better direction of tasks should be shared with Yatharth or the Coordinator; Also wait for their inputs. This is a failsafe in case of early corrections.
8. Check out the documents for coding guidelines.
9. all new pages must be implemented/coded in the latest available framework versions. ie. for every new design, implementation should start by downloading the fresh version from getbootstrap.com or the framework being used for laying out the design.
10. Makes pull requests with relevant descriptions.
11. Structure. Structure. This includes updating the commit text on Github

Please have a proper structure to the codes. Folder structure:

Directory structure to be-
1. assets/css/ — for css
2. assets/img/- for images
3. assets/js/ — for javascript
4. bootstrap/css- for css files which come along with bootstrap
5. bootstrap/js/ — for js files of bootstrap
6. index.html- home page
7. assets/fonts- for fonts
8. Index.html should be the default page.

                            The purpose of the Feedback Response Policy is important for shaping our product. Instead of reaching out to new users it is important for us to first know our existing users through feedback and serve them really well. We need to know how they're using our product and how we can make the product better suit their needs.
Every new feature should have a strong feedback system.

Tech team members must know what platform is the feedback coming from, to who, and from who, in the team (for ex. Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, Gmail, Freshdesk etc.). Also, keep a close track on- what percentage of feedbacks are coming from which platform. Keeping a track of the platforms will somewhere help while formulating marketing strategies because we'll know what platforms our users mostly use. We would know the unique user the feedback is coming from but for analysis purpose we will have to club the feedbacks together that are similar in nature to see the ones that are common. While some feedbacks may look similar but in reality they might be very different from each other. So clubbing of feedbacks need to be done intelligently. The bottom line is we have to know what the users are trying to tell us, and try to ensure that it's taken care of. This will lead to a healthy business and formation of a company with a strong foundation that has the customer's best interest in its heart.
Guruji’s further teams are spread over the teams of his respective startups. Those teams can’t be found here on this page for this page is strictly dedicated to the team of CHATTODO, but you can likely find them on the team pages of his other startups..</li>
