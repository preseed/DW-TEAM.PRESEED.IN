                                            The most exciting learning moment of it all was 'how to build an ego less
                                            company' - What does that even mean? It means a company without any door or
                                            roof or body or shape. No, ego less company is not a word that has been used
                                            ever perhaps, I coined it to explain yet another fundamentally different
                                            attribute of our company. The advantage of running a company like this is
                                            that I don't have to waste too much time in hiring or firing people, people
                                            can come in freely and walk out freely. THE GOODNESS OF THIS STRATEGY LIES
                                            IN THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO COME IN AND DON'T LEAVE.

                                        <br><br> I put the first word about Preseed in feb of 2012. Since then we have
                                        come a
                                        long way forward. From no money in my pocket and 1 person to no money in my
                                        pocket and 15+ people team. That means a lot of things, but this post is not
                                        about what all that could means, since, all that I have already indicated
                                        across my various writings about Preseed. This post is to describe how I

                                        One of the greatest difficulties that I face in running a company like
                                        Preseed in the world of people who have much greater egos than their
                                        knowledge (obviously, for, ego and knowledge are inversely proportional) is
                                        handling people with my little tolerance to bull shit excuses, careless
                                        attitude towards my company and mediocrity. Oftentimes their inflated egos
                                        make them want to quit immediately after that rare outburst from me. <br><br>
                                        Well obviously there is a good in even that event of that person leaving,
                                        the problem is the going also creates that negative vibe in the company
                                        because the company of individuals does not understand that coming and going
                                        is no big deal in a liberal culture like that <br><br>
                                        One needs to understand that if I pasted them they must have deserved it.
                                        Any way startup life is not so rosy and even the rose comes with thorns. If
                                        you can keep taking those blows and keep moving forward for the sake of our
                                        mission, then you most definitely deserve a chance not only to hold the
                                        stock but to lead one day for you listened well from those whose sincerity
                                        in Preseed is unquestionable. You need to understand that if I pasted you, I
                                        did it in the best interest of our company which is one thing you can’t
                                        doubt. Try it. <br><br>
                                        For me the best interest of preseed matters far over and above pleasing
                                        anyone. I am easy but those who are careless may not find me that easy after
                                        all. Find out about the strictness of Sri Yukteswara’s attributes as a
                                        teacher to Sri Yogananda Parhamansa and Steve Jobs/Elon Musk/Larry Page’s
                                        strictness as leaders of their teams. <br><br>

                                        <br><br>
                                        I don’t know about 2015 but I know if in 2014 I am doing anything that does not
                                        relate to Todoed then it is not the right way to go for me. I am saying that I
                                        have brought Preseed to a point where as long as it has you guys hustling
                                        together it will keep moving forward as long as each one has the intent to be
                                        there for each other. As long as that is there we have a structure and spirit to
                                        build an extraordinary company out of such relations we are forging. <br> <br>
                                        Anyway, so I am saying that please run the company smoothly so smoothly that I
                                        don’t have to interfere. <br> <br>
                                        If I am found doing anything else in the company other that building Chattodo
                                        then know without me saying,that you guys are not doing it right. I need to
                                        focus only on Chattodo. For everything else I have laid the foundation very
                                        thoughtfully in such a way that it can all be handled with my continued
                                        directions which will always be there, especially given that I have already
                                        written everything in detail all the way to the next 5 years of our works
                                        forward. Now we just have to fill the dots most of which are already indicated.
                                        Basically, I feel the blueprint is already created. Now we have to see how well
                                        you guys collaborate among each other and cooperate with each other. Just
                                        remember it is important to empathize with those you work with to truly
                                        understand their situations and intent at all times. That will help you make
                                        right and righteous decisions for each one of us. <br> <br>
                                        Please work hard. Preseed will not only be a mulit billion-dollar company but
                                        will also be a company that will inspire generations through truth and
                                        unparalleled transparency.

                            <span>After I failed in building my first consumer web product in 2010 with a near
                                $100,000 in investment. I decided to be that guy who the whimsical hackers and
                                designers were willing to lend their ears and skills to, regardless of the
                                compensation I was going to pay them, <b> for now there was going to be no
                                    money</b>, but
                                yet the same journey filled with <b> ideas, conviction and inspiration</b>. For I
                                always had
                                ideas, conviction and inspiration (right from my college days) that if coupled with
                                the skills of hackers and designers can translate into very meaningful web products
                                of great value to the users.</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To be that guy I had to be Preseed Web Lab, and for Preseed Web Lab to exist, there had
                            to be <a href="https://preseed.in/">Preseed</a> .
                            <br><br>
                            So after 1 year of starting Preseed in 2012. I am finally at a place —

                            <br><br>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Where I have been able to attract a hand full of hand picked hackers and
                                        designers I have now started to develop upon some cool app ideas with at
                                        Preseed Web Lab with a substantial share of the products with Preseed.</b>
                                </li>
                                <li>While every other secondary aspects of Preseed vis a vis Preseed Ecell, Preseed
                                    Anything Lab etc. is now handled by a bunch of other people who are inspired
                                    enough to build the culture of Preseed with or with out me. Hence, all I got to
                                    do with them is show them the path forward and guide them through a little each
                                    day. Which leaves me enough time to put a near 8 hours in a day into Preseed Web
                                    Lab, the primary aspect of Preseed.
                                </li>

                                <li>Where I have men who keep sharing with us the new age web tools, articles,
                                    products my team seeks to know about.</li>
                                <li>Where I can continue to live liberally as an artist and so can my team.
                                </li>
                                <br><br>
                                Note-: Our market is not the users of the end products we are making. Our market is
                                the counter cultured hackers, hustlers and designers we want to build stuff with. As
                                long as we get 30 such hackers and hustlers registered with Preseed Web Lab in the
                                next 2 years , we are good.
                                <br><br> Out of 30 such hackers, hustlers and designers we identify, we believe
                                atleast one team of 3 would have us build one great product.

The only thing that would satisfy him is the answer to why he exist, not intellectual but experiential. He did his post-graduation in TQM, but his heart and soul were solving the puzzle of life. In the end utter frustration and complete hopelessness makes his Guru decent upon him and open certain doors of existence. This was his second birth and henceforth he started expressing himself and doing lot of projects. From providing cure to chronic ailment, mental health, deaddiction, core capability enhancement, establishing the missing aspect in education.

                                The purpose of the Feedback Response Policy is important for shaping our product.
                                Instead of reaching out to new users it is important for us to first know our existing
                                users through feedback and serve them really well. We need to know how they're using our
                                product and how we can make the product better suit their needs. <br>
                                Every new feature should have a strong feedback system.
                                <br><br>
                                Tech team members must know what platform is the feedback coming from, to who, and from
                                who, in the team
                                (for ex. Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, Gmail, Freshdesk etc.). Also, keep a close track
                                on- what percentage of feedbacks are coming from which platform. Keeping a track of the
                                platforms will somewhere help while formulating marketing strategies because we'll know
                                what platforms our users mostly use.
                                We would know the unique user the feedback is coming from but for analysis purpose we
                                will have to club the feedbacks together that are similar in nature to see the ones that
                                are common. While some feedbacks may look similar but in reality they might be very
                                different from each other. So clubbing of feedbacks need to be done intelligently. The
                                bottom line is we have to know what the users are trying to tell us, and try to ensure
                                that it's taken care of. This will lead to a healthy business and formation of a company
                                with a strong foundation that has the customer's best interest in its heart.

                        Now we need money

                        The app has not been publically launched and hence, has traction in only double figures.
                        Therefore, there has been no need for us yet to have dabbled in cost or revenue
                        projections.

                                        I know there are a lot of Sunny Kesarwani's out there, just like, we are all the
                                        same, but only in our absolute silence. The moment we start surfacing after our
                                        long silence, as individuals, we realize there is just one Sunny Kesarwani, who
                                        decided to say no to all opportunities where traction and team were a far easier
                                        find. I decided to chase a chat app instead, in spite of the world of potential
                                        colleagues that thought this won't work, because the world doesn't need another
                                        chat app. Let's understand that one of us out of millions of us can be allowed
                                        to break the rule of getting to an investor before traction, because he is
                                        building a product that cannot come out as a MVP. Give me a minimum of $200,000
                                        absolutely
                                        now and let me have my team full time. In three months we will build the most
                                        beautiful chat app in the world. Then give us the rest of money to launch it to
                                        the world.

                                        There is no criteria for minimum value we may agree to, for, to have a good man
                                        as an investor, a man whose vibe I like, we may be willing to lower the monetary

                                        1. 1 year - The next round of investment our value, and hence your investment’s
                                        value, will be doubled with just 1000 active users. <br>
                                        2. We can bring back to life the dying billion dollar products like Evernote,
                                        wunderlist (microsoft), alive if they acquire us. <br>
                                        3. We have our eyes set on exploring a multi-million dollar part buy-out by

                                        Exit in the long-term for the investor - Whats App was acquired for $20 billion
                                        in 6 years. This will be too. By who? Facebook. Why? Facebook wants to be number
                                        1 in work collaboration space too, which we will win.
                                        Who doesn’t want to own an effective communication tool? Microsoft, Google,
                                        LInkedIn to Indian - Airtel, Directi, zoho?
                                        However, we desire to go the IPO way

                        <i> We have developed the prototype, not the launch version of the app. Why? Like
                            we said above - just imagine, will you use a chatting app in 2017 which looks and feels
                            worse than Whatsapp, Slack, Snapchat or Fb messenger? We won't. So for us to make the
                            presence of our app felt, we must spend at least 100 thousand dollars to actually build
                            a finger licking beautiful product to launch it with the optimism that it will eat up
                            some of the market share of communication away from Whatsapp, FB messenger and Slack.
                            This implies that every waking hour of ours must go into the broad understanding of the
                            market, vision and team camaraderie first; then the development of the app, then the
                            launch of the app, and then following of metrics and somewhere along the way, dabbling
                            in projections will happen.

                            No traction yet for the main mobile app. Why? Why am I still pursuing investment when
                            there is not even a launch?
                            Because this product is about a chatapp. Chatting apps cannot be made and launched as
                            half baked MVPs for the world
                            We need investment to support the team so that our great team can continue to build a
                            great product with some confidence in the captain, that is I, that I will take care of
                            their bread and butter. Not everyone required in this team will have the same appetite
                            for risk as I.
                            Traction we have achieved so far: None. So far we were not chasing traction. We were
                            fighting personal odds and chasing a vision & design that required years of sacrifices
                            away from the norms of chasing traction common to apps with lesser time to chase vision,
                            because they are too busy chasing the incremental changes in the status quo.</i>

                        <br> <br>Peter Thiel became a billionaire by investing half a million dollars in Facebook before
                        anyone else. Today he runs a fund which has invested in some of the world’s best startups.
                        <br><br>
                        Chattodo has a similar potential. You can be an investor in it by investing a half of what Peter
                        Thiel did. This is a matter of a new kind of a social network.

                                        <b> Why the standard question of traction may not be the most
                                            appropriate question for a moonshot innovation in its nascent stage when
                                            founders are seeking support from investors to continue their R&D towards
                                            launch?</b> <br><br>

                                        For now, let's turn the lens on another kind of traction- which we have
                                        already created- meaningful moments and activities noticed by users, media
                                        and the tech community. <br><br>
                                        I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing
                                        traction instead of a chasing a world changing vision which did not fit the
                                        bill for the rule of - build MVP - followed by traction, before I could
                                        raise money. Please tell me how I would then change the world for the
                                        better? <br><br>
                                        Start-up land is littered with failure. <br><br>
                                        Every hack on smart investing will preach that before approaching an
                                        investor you must have dragged your feet over the thorns littered over that
                                        holiest of grails- TRACTION. For after all what good is a business that does
                                        not yield profits? Yet, if that critical question on TRACTION is duly asked
                                        and answered before any investment, why the high rates of failure and a
                                        subsequent celebration of failure as the norm in start-up land?
                                        Could it be that the holy grail itself is flawed in a period where most of
                                        our problems have been solved or are perceived to have been solved to an
                                        acceptable degree beyond which improvements are not possible in a human,
                                        hence imperfect world? <br><br>
                                        I say YES. <br><br>
                                        Most start-ups offer incremental changes, but what if you had a moon- shot
                                        innovation for a problem the world has ceased to consider as one. Or a
                                        problem considered solved? <br><br>
                                        Moonshots, by their very definition, need to be hurtled until something big
                                        is identified. The innovation after that identification might take time, in
                                        some cases, a very long time. (Would you not say that the problem you are
                                        addressing is a blind spot- that the best in chatting-productivity has been
                                        achieved and that is just the start of the moon shot you must make to
                                        disrupt existing models of education?)

                                        Yes, you can’t code, don’t have the time to learn so you hire the best
                                        to code for you. It must not surprise you that great people come at a
                                        cost. Those great people may have had a life of their own before they
                                        met a vision that I imparted to them and wished to be consumed by it but
                                        for the mundane but real considerations of everyday living. <br><br>
                                        More so, one requires neat sums of money for the world will not accept a
                                        MVP that challenges its collective blind spot. <br><br>
                                        So, my challenge is to manifest a never-before vision into a
                                        finger-licking good looking product that elicits a collective gasp of
                                        “why did we not see that earlier”, from the world. <br><br>
                                        (To those who repeat the trite Form Follows Function rule, let me quote
                                        just one example- Snapchat, that turned that norm on its head. It was a
                                        beautiful but tedious product to begin with. It bettered itself over
                                        time) <br><br>
                                        Money, of course- now. <br><br>
                                        Traction, not just yet. <br><br>
                                        I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing

                                        Once this is done my first step of marketing will be to go and pitch it to the
                                        best companies in Silicon Valley.
                                        <a href="http://preseeded.preseed.in">Preseeded.preseed.in</a> is being planned
                                        and built for the future more than the present status quo. <br> <br>
                                        Reading it will keep your awareness about us, all the way, to the future. We
                                        will soo pitch Chattodo to employees of companies like Twitter, Google etc. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        For this I will be speaking directly with two of my good friends - YC Almunus,
                                        Sachin, who had also serveed as a Product manager Twitter. When that time comes.
                                        That is our core focused marketing which I will do myself. Through them I will
                                        try to get it into the hands of the employees of those companies. I will focus
                                        on that. That is the kind of start I want from my own marketing time spent. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        So I build the product and pitch it to employees of top companies. That will be
                                        the highest use case of Chattodo I want to focus on that. And just that. It
                                        entails, building a great product, and then talking to great people about it.
                                        <br> <br>
                                        Also writing to best media blogs in the world about it. I want the start of my
                                        personal marketing effort to happen from there.
                                        I will stick to what I am good at, writing, I will write a thorough article
                                        about productivity and the future of roofless offices and distributed teams. All
                                        the way to how ideas can be built without capital and with Todoed and some faith
                                        in one another. This article would have the potential to be read by 1000s of
                                        impactful early stage entrepreneurs.

                            We value simplicity - in our world we pride ourselves on our design aesthetics. This opening
                            is
                            not for anyone who feel their vibes flow strong with ours, unless you are someone with a
                            subtle
                            design sensibility and leadership fire to inspire a team of designers. Over the past few
                            years
                            we have learned that designers in themselves are a very different type of leader - one we
                            would
                            need to balance out the Reactor Core. There are countless projects related to design going
                            on in
                            Preseed and your role would require you to have hawkeyes over them along with the team of
                            extraordinary talent built around you. If your values resonate with ours - connect with
                            someone
                            in the team, but before that - apply.</span><br>

                            <br>


                            <strong>Partner the geeks and hustlers and create marketable products by design.</strong>
                            This is where extraordinary front end men and women look after those aspects of the product
                            that the users will interact with. This is the team that finally makes Preseed products
                            marketable by design. <br><br>
                            This stage for Preseed typically starts when the initial idea is prototyped into a MVP and
                            now it is time for it to start interacting with the users. <br><br>
                            Now let me elaborate a very important remark I just made, ‘ The team that makes products
                            marketable by design’, through the eyes of Preseed -: <br><br>
                            Step 1 — We get the geeks to hear our ideas, get inspired, code and deliver the MVP of the
                            idea discussed. Until this point they handle the front end as hackers not as designers. This
                            works to speedily get prototypes ready for our testing, may be sometimes even private beta
                            launch because ‘we like to launch fast, even if the design is rather embarrassing’. <br><br>
                            <br><br>
                            <img src="./img/reid.png" alt="" class="img img-responsive">
                            <br><br>
                            Step 2 — The MVP is now ready for the play. Remember it is still not the best UI even though
                            we can imagine it, for we don’t think we want to spend our resources to create the best UI
                            for it yet, for it first needs to be launched to the real users. So once the MVP is tested
                            privately, we open the exact same thing for the users, and then continue iterating till we
                            see some customer traction <br><br>
                            Step 3 — This is when you come in. At this stage we have some real customer metrics. This is
                            really when an idea starts looking like it is ready and worthy of more resources. The MVP
                            now has a hand full of users using it, while it had designs that were not the kinds we would
                            like to see in products we use as users. So clearly it is a good sign that the product is
                            making sense even though it is not well designed. <br><br>
                            Step 4 — Marketing through design. Do you know what we mean? This is when the products are
                            brought to the team at Ugly MVP. This is when Preseed Web Lab finds its front end artists.
                            <br><br>
                            Step 5 — Once we have created a UI that work, we start distributing the product, through
                            media, popular bloggers, relevant forums, early adopters, distribution apps etc. <br><br>
                            Step 6 — We keep trying till we either fail or we succeed. <br><br>
                            Step 7 — We move on to our next product. <br><br>
                            Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems we
                            see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong
                            engineers. It’s a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web ‘design’
                            sensibilities. The reason stands — lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool people.
                            We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products. <br><br>
                            For now we are looking for just 1 user interaction designer who is willing to commit
                            themselves to Preseed and its products/startups/clients. We won’t pay these designers any
                            salary or immediate compensation. We will instead offer the designers upto 2% ownership in
                            Preseed soon enough perhaps immediately after 3 months of our active working relationship.

                            Note -: Preseed is going to command substantial ownerships in a lot of future startups. Even
                            1% ownership at Preseed may be of a huge monetary value someday. <br><br>

    This is stuff made of dreams. Once upon a time, there was a dream Nishchal had nurtured as a mere drawing for a new kind of a social network on his chart papers, backed with $100,000 worth of investments in 2009. Thereafter, Parag was among the first people to have joined Nishchal to build their first company in 2009. At that time Parag had just graduated from IIT Delhi. Nishchal is still on it, and Parag is just a call away. <br><br> Nishchal & Parag have shared a great relationship over the last 10 years while Nishchal was in the Himalayas and Parag was in San Francisco.

                            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>

                            And be one traveler, long I stood<br>

                            To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                            <br>
                            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                            And having perhaps the better claim<br>
                            Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br>
                            Though as for that the passing there<br>
                            Had worn them really about the same,<br>
                            <br>
                            And both that morning equally lay<br>
                            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                            Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br>
                            I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
                            <br>
                            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>

                            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br>
                            I took the one less traveled by,<br>

                        <strong>INTRODUCTION TO DAILY UPDATES PROCESS/protocol AT PRESEED STARTUPS </strong>
                        <br> <br>
                        Welcome to Preseed, where <br> <br>
                        WE INSPIRE <br> <br>
                        IDEAS I FAITH I ACTION <br> <br>
                        Your decision to join Preseed is very inspirational and it clearly indicates your faith in
                        Preseed culture.
                        Here you not only get to perform at the highest level as an individual but you also have a
                        strong team support. Apart from the tasks assigned to you, one of the most important
                        protocols
                        to act upon is the #daily-updates.
                        Every morning, you have to update about your day to be, meaning the tasks you will perform
                        during the day.
                        <br> <br>

                        At the end of the day you will need to update again on the tasks completed or worked upon
                        and
                        the status of it. this flow of communication will happen via #daily-updates channel on your
                        startup's slack community.
                        <br> <br>

                        Length of your updates can be as small as you like. Daily update should not be looked as a
                        botheration to anyone. It should be seen as a macro implication.
                        <br> <br>

                        The daily updates become a reference point of work for the next day.

                        <br> <br>

                        Imagine Preseed to be operating in a physical work space. Every morning you come to the
                        office.
                        The day begins with a 10 am meeting ritual with the captain. You discuss your daily
                        activities
                        and your day to be. Daily updates help Nishchal keep one individual's work well co ordinated
                        with the 20 others , that collectively impact Preseed. Directly or indirectly. It also gives
                        him
                        a sense of daily activities in our organization. So update daily, regardless. The captain
                        has to
                        know at all times what his team is working on every single day.
                        Daily update is just an unbiased update about whatever one did that day / the previous day,
                        in
                        brief. Planning is definitely important and worthy of an update.
                        The daily update just needs to be a brief update strictly for a layman; when looking at the
                        daily updates day by day, that lay man should feel there is progress.
                        Hurry up. Join Slack. Start Updating!

                            <li> Minutes should be written down in bullets and no point is to be missed.</li>

                        Minutes document would contain the agenda(s) of the meeting as bullets and the discussion
                        which
                        took place for each agenda should be written down in sub bullets.

                            <li>A asked team why were they not giving daily updates but B and C had no answer. A
                                asked
                                them to ensure they give daily updates.</li>
                            <li>Even if you guys do nothing please, do not mind posting that you have done nothing.
                            </li>

                            (all three are the brief of the discussion which took place regarding the agenda)</li>

                        <strong>
                            The Minutes of Meeting that is done among two or more team members need to be recorded
                            and
                            shared within 24 hours so that there is speed with transparency to fuel our progress. I
                            think the idea of the Minutes are pretty clear but the following are some guidelines.

                        </strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Minutes will be shared in relevant fb workgroups, not emails unless specified. If you
                        remember
                        my last post about minutes here. I clearly specified its got to be in the workgroup.
                        <br><br>
                        However, the conclusion from the minutes would go into relevant spreadsheets. <br><br>
                        For Example; So when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thind.aman">Aman Thind</a> shares the
                        minute here the coordinators will take the relevant elements the right folder. <br><br>
                        Nishchal and coordinators, keep themselves tuned with activities across Preseed through
                        following them on slack channels, through the cc: coordinator@preseed.in , and through
                        minutes

            How are teams built? - Other team members' contribution to finding new talents for their team is
            paramount.
            Each one should take upon themselves in growing their teams. <br> So I am clearly saying if you talent
            around you
            with counter culture beliefs that resonate with Preseed values, create introductions of such people with
            us,
            <br> along with your views on what agenda could we build upon with the fellow being you have found for
            us.
            <br>
            Delegation of work - MOST IMPORTANT Everyone must learn over a period of time of course, 'the art of
            building their own team'. <br> The biggest attribute we see in our people is 'how well can they inspire
            others to
            work with them' if you need money to build your team then you need to see how Nishchal is building his
            team.

                                    The purpose of this protocol, is to ensure that every Preseed Team members’
                                    communication is effective
                                    and uniform so that we all follow certain protocols that define our communications
                                    well with each other.
                                    Key here is to be fast and mindful. Empathise with other team members who you are
                                    communicating with.
                                    Any questions or suggestions please feel free to share with the Coordinators.

                                    learn from the conversation that takes place. Another reason is to be able to
                                    amplify the reach of
                                    messages (when needed) and protocols from Preseed team to reach other teams in
