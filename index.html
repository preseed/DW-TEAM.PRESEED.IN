                                <span>After I failed in building my first consumer web product in 2010 with a near
                                    $100,000 in investment. I decided to be that guy who the whimsical hackers and
                                    designers were willing to lend their ears and skills to, regardless of the
                                    compensation I was going to pay them, <b> for now there was going to be no
                                        money</b>, but
                                    yet the same journey filled with <b> ideas, conviction and inspiration</b>. For I
                                    always had
                                    ideas, conviction and inspiration (right from my college days) that if coupled with
                                    the skills of hackers and designers can translate into very meaningful web products
                                    of great value to the users.</span>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To be that guy I had to be Preseed Web Lab, and for Preseed Web Lab to exist, there had
                                to be <a href="https://preseed.in/">Preseed</a> .
                                <br><br>
                                So after 1 year of starting Preseed in 2012. I am finally at a place —

                                <br><br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>Where I have been able to attract a hand full of hand picked hackers and
                                            designers I have now started to develop upon some cool app ideas with at
                                            Preseed Web Lab with a substantial share of the products with Preseed.</b>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>While every other secondary aspects of Preseed vis a vis Preseed Ecell, Preseed
                                        Anything Lab etc. is now handled by a bunch of other people who are inspired
                                        enough to build the culture of Preseed with or with out me. Hence, all I got to
                                        do with them is show them the path forward and guide them through a little each
                                        day. Which leaves me enough time to put a near 8 hours in a day into Preseed Web
                                        Lab, the primary aspect of Preseed.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Where I have men who keep sharing with us the new age web tools, articles,
                                        products my team seeks to know about.</li>
                                    <li>Where I can continue to live liberally as an artist and so can my team.
                                    </li>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Note-: Our market is not the users of the end products we are making. Our market is
                                    the counter cultured hackers, hustlers and designers we want to build stuff with. As
                                    long as we get 30 such hackers and hustlers registered with Preseed Web Lab in the
                                    next 2 years , we are good.
                                    <br><br> Out of 30 such hackers, hustlers and designers we identify, we believe
                                    atleast one team of 3 would have us build one great product.

                                The most exciting learning moment of it all was 'how to build an ego less
                                company' - What does that even mean? It means a company without any door or
                                roof or body or shape. No, ego less company is not a word that has been used
                                ever perhaps, I coined it to explain yet another fundamentally different
                                attribute of our company. The advantage of running a company like this is
                                that I don't have to waste too much time in hiring or firing people, people
                                can come in freely and walk out freely. THE GOODNESS OF THIS STRATEGY LIES
                                IN THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO COME IN AND DON'T LEAVE.

                            <br><br> I put the first word about Preseed in feb of 2012. Since then we have
                            come a
                            long way forward. From no money in my pocket and 1 person to no money in my
                            pocket and 15+ people team. That means a lot of things, but this post is not
                            about what all that could means, since, all that I have already indicated
                            across my various writings about Preseed. This post is to describe how I
                            plan to distribute stocks to employees of Preseed <br><br>

                            One of the greatest difficulties that I face in running a company like
                            Preseed in the world of people who have much greater egos than their
                            knowledge (obviously, for, ego and knowledge are inversely proportional) is
                            handling people with my little tolerance to bull shit excuses, careless
                            attitude towards my company and mediocrity. Oftentimes their inflated egos
                            make them want to quit immediately after that rare outburst from me. <br><br>
                            Well obviously there is a good in even that event of that person leaving,
                            the problem is the going also creates that negative vibe in the company
                            because the company of individuals does not understand that coming and going
                            is no big deal in a liberal culture like that <br><br>
                            One needs to understand that if I pasted them they must have deserved it.
                            Any way startup life is not so rosy and even the rose comes with thorns. If
                            you can keep taking those blows and keep moving forward for the sake of our
                            mission, then you most definitely deserve a chance not only to hold the
                            stock but to lead one day for you listened well from those whose sincerity
                            in Preseed is unquestionable. You need to understand that if I pasted you, I
                            did it in the best interest of our company which is one thing you can’t
                            doubt. Try it. <br><br>
                            For me the best interest of preseed matters far over and above pleasing
                            anyone. I am easy but those who are careless may not find me that easy after
                            all. Find out about the strictness of Sri Yukteswara’s attributes as a
                            teacher to Sri Yogananda Parhamansa and Steve Jobs/Elon Musk/Larry Page’s
                            strictness as leaders of their teams. <br><br>

                            For ego stock post — 
                            <br><br>
                            I don’t know about 2015 but I know if in 2014 I am doing anything that does not
                            relate to Todoed then it is not the right way to go for me. I am saying that I
                            have brought Preseed to a point where as long as it has you guys hustling
                            together it will keep moving forward as long as each one has the intent to be
                            there for each other. As long as that is there we have a structure and spirit to
                            build an extraordinary company out of such relations we are forging. <br> <br>
                            Anyway, so I am saying that please run the company smoothly so smoothly that I
                            don’t have to interfere. <br> <br>
                            If I am found doing anything else in the company other that building Chattodo
                            then know without me saying,that you guys are not doing it right. I need to
                            focus only on Chattodo. For everything else I have laid the foundation very
                            thoughtfully in such a way that it can all be handled with my continued
                            directions which will always be there, especially given that I have already
                            written everything in detail all the way to the next 5 years of our works
                            forward. Now we just have to fill the dots most of which are already indicated.
                            Basically, I feel the blueprint is already created. Now we have to see how well
                            you guys collaborate among each other and cooperate with each other. Just
                            remember it is important to empathize with those you work with to truly
                            understand their situations and intent at all times. That will help you make
                            right and righteous decisions for each one of us. <br> <br>
                            Please work hard. Preseed will not only be a mulit billion-dollar company but
                            will also be a company that will inspire generations through truth and
                            unparalleled transparency.

                                scratch, from that rock bottom. This situation must have had something to do with

                                Somewhere along the way, Nishchal got offers from companies like <a

                                as a co-founder and director. He had to politely turned those offers by these

                                observed in him:</div>

                            <div class="pem" align="left">1. His extraordinary mass consumer ideas.<br>
                                2. His courageous way of being, leading and creating.<br>
                                3. His ability to execute those ideas to become MVPs without a single penny. (This
                                is
                                the most
                                important point: it would have reduced the cost of important experimentation in
                                India by
                                more

                                4. His ability to communicate extremly complex ideas as smaller fragments
                                effectively
                                and

                                6. His courage to do before anyone else and his ability to face odds before anyone
                                else
                                will

                                bottom.
                                Every
                                penny
                                he makes, he invested in his software whims to do good in this society. He continued
                                to
                                compensate
                                his
                                teams, over and above his own survival, to at times sleep with no roof, cash, food
                                and
                                phone.
                                Even
                                his
                                family lost all of it a long time ago when he was barely 20. He was pressed by his
                                family and
                                well
                                wishers to take up a job, for he was receiving lucrative job offers by the day. He
                                was
                                criticized
                                by
                                those who ones loved him. A person in his situation should have not survived. In
                                this
                                period of
                                struggle, no one came to his aid. He kept his head held high, didn’t take up a job
                                and
                                still
                                sails
                                forward like a warrior on his mission to free the world from present structures,
                                boundaries and
                                meanings. This journey is leading him into a true story of rarest courage and
                                conviction, as it
                                unfolds before the world, in more action than words, over a long period of time.

                                He is in his early 30s, and has a way to express his theory of no god or the origin
                                of
                                the

                                its end and what after the end, without using religion and mysticism. We have never
                                known anyone
                                who
                                can express such complex ideas with such ease, passion and simplicity. When one asks
                                him, how do
                                you
                                know all this and how do you dabble between spirituality and the material world of
                                technology.
                                He
                                says, "Firsly, none of what I know is my own. It is all just flowing through me. The
                                reason for
                                that
                                is resonation. I am at the same frequency as the fundamental truth itself". And then
                                he
                                goes on

                                explain how energy flows into each other and how shapes and forms take place. So,

                        <p align="center" style="font-size: small; font-weight: 400;">

                            When I was starting Preseed, I used to tell people that I am going to build a
                            company where I could float my many ideas and see them take shape.
                            The first step to building a company like that, was to build a culture like that
                            of a hand full of people who believed in not only my ideas but my world views.
                            The next step was to instill so much inspiration in them all that they go all
                            the way to enable me or assist me further to shape up those ideas.
                            The next step was to put them in order, a system, a set of protocols.
                            Now comes the next step. The step in which we create a very simple modal box for
                            each idea of ours and link it with MyIdealist, earlier called Idealistr.
                            This complete step if done right, including marketing, will have the potential
                            to blow things out of proportion for us, meaning, since the cost of
                            experimentation at Preseed is unbelievably low because of our altrusitic and
                            courage filled works, at such lower costs, now almost all our ideas can start
                            taking shape, from the moment we find an inspired hacker who is intrinsically
                            motivated to build that product with us, for reasons not only limited to the
                            goodness in the idea of the product, but because he sees the goodness in teaming
                            up with us.<br><br>
                            Similarly, MyIdealsit, will give you the dashboard to publish your ideas that
                            you have deeply thought of and from that moment on, would like to publish to be
                            read by your future teams.
                            This project will move forward to becoming a simple mobile app where your
                            network will get instantly notified everytime a new idea is added, so that they
                            can go to it's link on MyIdealist and know more about the idea or start a
                            dialogue with you about it right there.
                            <br><br>
                            There will be comments feature too. It will be a way of collecting testimonials
                            by those who have had the chance of having discussed the idea with us. (Rest of
                            the ability of commenting on the idea for the purpose of understanding the
                            idea - will be handled at MyIdealist). Here the commenting will serve the
                            purpose of marketing of your ideas.
                            <br><br>
                            MyIdealist will lead to creating a network of evangelists for your ideas. They
                            follow you based on your ideas and not because of your controversies.

                            Blast from the recent past  from 2012 —  First, Nishchal started this community,
                            Preseed, as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thepreseed">FB page</a> to
                            empower entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs personally through mentoring
                            them over my lectures in top colleges and through personal phone calls. Then,
                            with the lessons of running that community for 2 years Nishchal started to build
                            a web product called Idealistr in 2014 (find it in step 3 of <a
                                href="https://preseeded.preseed.in/">
                                preseeded.preseed.in</a>) to empower potential entrepreneurs, across the
                            world, by
                            suitably profiling them and making them discoverable. The main problem faced by
                            aspiring entrepreneurs who want to turn an idea into reality is getting good
                            talent. Idealistr aimed to solve that problem by helping change makers find the
                            right cofounders/volunteers for their idea to bring it to reality. Idealistr was
                            also meant to lay the foundation for attracting angel investors. This was a
                            product for philosophers, engineers, doers, remote coworkers, entrepreneurs and
                            aspiring entrepreneurs.
                            <br><br>
                            Also, Nishchal had been dreaming since 2009 to channel the creations of
                            technology students across the country towards solving real-world problems. So
                            there is a wholesome growth in our society of students and solution seekers,
                            which is the society as a whole. This can be achieved in a more social and
                            democratic ways than that can be seen so far for there is a vision for a very
                            noble cause but that vision needs to be translated into a vision for a web
                            product and not a mere website. Thus making it more scalable. And this is true
                            for us too.

                            Todoed is made up of I(could be the ceo) and Dhaval(could be the cto) full time. And
                            there are two
                            part time advisors (passive tech advisor - Saikiran and fairly active tech advisor/hands
                            on
                            coder/backend Ansal). <br>
                            This is the Todoed core team - I and Dhaval. This is all I need. This, all the way to
                            cover,
                            chrome extension(all to do with text - 75% done) and iOS (all to do with voice and
                            text). This is
                            the iOS/backend/marketing/design team. <br>
                            It is Todoed on iOS that ultimately will solve my own problem fully that I envisioned it
                            to do for
                            me first. Todoed as a chrome extension has been able to do it only partly. <br>
                            I started my journey to inspire ideas, faith (in each other), and action among all I
                            come in
                            contact with. So, I started Preseed. Found Dhaval on that journey and mandated him to
                            build upon
                            my vision for the product, that productifies Preseed, to enable more potential
                            entrepreneurs to
                            build. The prototype is here <a href="http://myidealist.co">www.myidealist.co</a> . Now
                            while
                            journeying over this I realised a problem with my own fellows and community at Preseed,
                            where
                            actionable tasks sent over chat, kept getting lost. I told Dhaval to transfer the task
                            of building
                            MyIdealist to our other coworkers at Preseed and join me asap at building Todoed. <br>
                            In brief the above paragraph should give you a glimse over my exact motivation: <br><br>
                            1. To make people more productive. <br>
                            2. For the purpose of building ideas. <br> <br>
                            Todoed should help people be more productive for the purpose of building ideas. Some day
                            a text
                            with '#idea' in Todoed will create more possibilities for users of Todoed to transition
                            that idea
                            into a MVP and then perhaps a startup. That day Todoed and MyIdealist will be very
                            closely
                            integrated. But this year, that can even be a part of dialogue. Because this year is
                            about
                            everything in Todoed except this '#idea'.
                            <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>
                            This is Todoed being built for the present or what I call 'the Todoed operational
                            parallel': <br>
                            <br>
                            We get tremendous invaluable support from Preseed, the noise free community of self
                            inspired
                            potential entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs, I started 3 years ago. That support will
                            continue
                            forever. That support means the ball at Todoed is always rolling. The hustle is always
                            on.
                            Independent of money, office, materials. It's a bonus. Large bonus. That is capable of
                            producing
                            the product, even if Dhaval and I were not there. (But Dhaval is there, has been and
                            will be,
                            forever, so had/have/will I. I have shared a profound and deeply action oriented
                            relationship with
                            Dhaval for 2 years now). <br>
                            Preseed is now represented through Govind, coordinator at Preseed; to Raj, who handles
                            Todoed at
                            Preseed, and hence is the coordinator at Todoed, meaning Raj's mandate is to extract the
                            juices
                            out of the Preseed team/network for the purpose of building Todoed, independent of the
                            works of
                            the core team of Todoed. <br>
                            Operational parallel: Raj; under my day to day directions and suggestions in freelance
                            arrangement
                            with Ansal, and advisory from Kartik Mandavidalle; with an open access to human
                            resources of
                            Preseed. This is how we have so far, Built the chrome extension; measuring it, learning
                            it,
                            repeating it. All the way to making it the best productivity chrome extension in the
                            world. This
                            is truly exactly the process that built Todoed thus far. And that is the exact process
                            that will
                            continue to build it further over the next 3 months. <br>
                            We think our chrome extension will be perfect by that time. While this is going on, Raj
                            will
                            continue to market the product and study the user metric and behavior. And then further
                            market it
                            upon those lessons. This is all about the Chrome extension. <br>
                            So there is also Raj in the Todoed team. He was my second in command at Preseed. Now he
                            is my
                            second in command in Todoed. <br>
                            Three of us are building Todoed at 0 costs to Todoed, from our own homes, I in Lucknow,
                            Raj in
                            Kolkatta, Dhaval in Ranchi. Whatever little server/freelancer costs, Preseed/Preseed
                            network takes
                            care of it. That is how we have done things and can do for a long period of time. We
                            are,in one
                            regard, self sustained. <br>
                            However, if we raise money, I can raise the bar -: <br> <br>
                            <br> 1. I want to set up a beautiful conducive office/infrastructure in Lucknow to come
                            under one
                            roof to build and grow a great roof to work from, physically also together, not just
                            mentally.
                            <br> 2. Build the product to my satisfaction in 3 months, and take I and Dhaval to
                            Silicon Valley
                            (leaving Raj and others to hustle in India), to work closely with a marketer/growth
                            hacker who has
                            been there done that. We want to go to him with a product, which is ready to be marketed
                            at his
                            full ability. I have the vision for the product, which can attract among the best
                            marketers and
                            growthhackers in the world, if we can compensate them suitablly. (This is a 100%
                            consumer web 100%
                            tech product and there is no reason for me to not build it from the place and in the
                            neighbourhood
                            of people who have done it the best).

He said,  "Sometimes I just want to live a simple life, be in love, go to parties, drink and dance. Smoke pot and play sports. Travel the mountains and oceans. Make my own furniture. Roll in green meadows. Watch the stars and satellites. Just like any of you. My alter ego, however, at all times, wants to just build a great company that takes human culture, to freedom. For, I cannot unsee, what I have seen. And in my attempt to gratifying my senses, I may leave nothing for my children to cherish, but intoxication; unless I use my knowledge to see our children, in everyone, especially those who suffer".</figcaption>

                                Nishchal is here to sincerely help change your status quo, to ensure that you get at
                                least one shot to
                                do something impactfully different. His attributes are as different as the result he
                                wants to create,
                                even culturally. Some of those attributes of his we love while some others find
                                amusing:
                                <br><br>

                                1) He rides bicycles and shows up for most meetings(and parties) in shorts and
                                t-shirts, needless to
                                say, sweaty and muddy. He doesn’t care about what he is wearing and he also doesn’t
                                care about what
                                you are wearing.
                                <br><br>
                                2) He has huge concerns over effective visual communications, especially if you are
                                designing to
                                communicate with your customers for customers won't get into long verbose
                                conversations with you. He
                                feels if you invest on communications right, it would really facilitate his task of
                                ‘GROWING THE
                                COMPANY’. If you are an alive company with some real on the ground traction,
                                sometimes, the first
                                job he may want to get done for you is getting this aspect of your business right.
                                We hope we will
                                find you prepared to invest time and money on this.
                                <br><br>
                                Note -: Good designs seek good payments. If you are not willing to pay the graphic
                                designers well,
                                we won’t take the responsibility of your visual communications. Actually this stands
                                true for any
                                vendor services.
                                <br><br>
                                3) He may get really really profound and verbose at times, almost on a whim, but
                                that's because he
                                has a very liberated sense of possibilities, passion backed with logics that may
                                take you time to
                                comprehend just like most groundbreaking logics in physics may take time to
                                comprehend.
                                <br><br>

                                4) He is even further north of the optimistic side, from other people’s perspectives
                                (especially those
                                who are still found conducting business in traditional ways*). HE IS REALLY REALLY
                                DREAMY, YET SIMPLE.

                                <br><br>
                                5) He never thinks not backed by an investor is a problem or a big deal, so you also
                                please stop
                                assuming that it is. It definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it
                                should not mean
                                you stop the hustle. Be creative in even how you make your ends meet. <i>Where there
                                    is a will there
                                    is a way</i>. Look carefully at how he is trying to do the same for himself.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Traditional ways :-</b><br><br>
                                A) Poor visual communication.
                                <br>
                                B) Without harnessing the internet.
                                <br>
                                C) Unclearly defined roles and responsibilities of the staff.
                                <br>
                                D) Uninspired management apart from the co-owners.
                                <br>
                                E) No Business plan.
                                <br>
                                F) Ineffective or delegation of tasks.
                                <br>
                                G) Unoptimized resource including the available human resource.
                                <br>
                                H) Little or no funding.
                                <br>
                                I) Disbelief and bad payments against exceptional quality.

                                <br><br>
                                At PRESEED YOGA these are also some of the aspects we work on.<br><br>
                                5) He never thinks money is a problem or a big deal, so you also please stop
                                assuming that it is. It
                                definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it should not mean you
                                stop the hustle.

                                6) He will say a point once and in most cases, it would be communicated to you in
                                written words. We
                                already assume that you are inspired enough to take action on the point he has
                                stated. So, don’t
                                expect us to send reminders or follow up till you yourself write to us telling us
                                the status of
                                whatever the point of concern was. He hates to repeat. It's not an ego thing. It's
                                the ‘duplication
                                of the same effort’ that he is against. It is the same as inefficiency.
                                <br><br>
                                7) Twitter is one of the best ways to get in touch with him. He prefer it over
                                emails and phone
                                calls.
                                <br><br>
                                8) We hate to see his time getting wasted with you. You are not the only
                                business/idea/goal/dream he
                                is dealing with. So, please value his time. Value your time too. If you save him
                                time, he will most
                                certainly make this world a better place.
                                <br><br>
                                9) He is critical(but not over critical) and brutally honest. In fact so much that
                                sometimes we lose
                                people for they get offended. But, that helps us in filtering bozos. We just hope
                                you are not one of
                                them who we lose.
                                <br><br>
                                10) If you are not being creative and liberal, we are not interested in you.

The only thing that would satisfy him is the answer to why he exist, not intellectual but experiential. He did his post-graduation in TQM, but his heart and soul were solving the puzzle of life. In the end utter frustration and complete hopelessness makes his Guru decent upon him and open certain doors of existence. This was his second birth and henceforth he started expressing himself and doing lot of projects. From providing cure to chronic ailment, mental health, deaddiction, core capability enhancement, establishing the missing aspect in education. Basically, discovering and implementing tools and techniques of empowerment to the mankind.</span><br><br><br><br>

                            The purpose of the Feedback Response Policy is important for shaping our product.
                            Instead of reaching out to new users it is important for us to first know our
                            existing
                            users through feedback and serve them really well. We need to know how they're using
                            our
                            product and how we can make the product better suit their needs. <br>
                            Every new feature should have a strong feedback system.
                            <br><br>
                            Tech team members must know what platform is the feedback coming from, to who, and
                            from
                            who, in the team
                            (for ex. Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, Gmail, Freshdesk etc.). Also, keep a close
                            track
                            on- what percentage of feedbacks are coming from which platform. Keeping a track of
                            the
                            platforms will somewhere help while formulating marketing strategies because we'll
                            know
                            what platforms our users mostly use.
                            We would know the unique user the feedback is coming from but for analysis purpose
                            we
                            will have to club the feedbacks together that are similar in nature to see the ones
                            that
                            are common. While some feedbacks may look similar but in reality they might be very
                            different from each other. So clubbing of feedbacks need to be done intelligently.
                            The
                            bottom line is we have to know what the users are trying to tell us, and try to
                            ensure
                            that it's taken care of. This will lead to a healthy business and formation of a
                            company
                            with a strong foundation that has the customer's best interest in its heart.

                    Now we need money
                    to get to the launch ready version.
                    The app has not been publically launched and hence, has traction in only double figures.
                    Therefore, there has been no need for us yet to have dabbled in cost or revenue
                    projections.

                    chat first
                    application for android as our first step towards this vision expressed as step 0 to step 2.
                    At
                    modest estimates, I
                    envision 1

                            I know there are a lot of Sunny Kesarwani's out there, just like, we are all

                            long silence, as individuals, we realize there is just one Sunny Kesarwani,

                            decided to say no to all opportunities where traction and team were a far
                            easier
                            find. I decided to chase a chat app instead, in spite of the world of
                            potential
                            colleagues that thought this won't work, because the world doesn't need
                            another
                            chat app. Let's understand that one of us out of millions of us can be
                            allowed
                            to break the rule of getting to an investor before traction, because he is
                            building a product that cannot come out as a MVP. Give me a minimum of
                            $200,000
                            absolutely
                            now and let me have my team full time. In three months we will build the
                            most
                            beautiful chat app in the world. Then give us the rest of money to launch it
                            to
                            the world.

                            There is no criteria for minimum value we may agree to, for, to have a good

                            as an investor, a man whose vibe I like, we may be willing to lower the

                        <i> We have developed the prototype, not the launch version of the app. Why? Like
                            we said above - just imagine, will you use a chatting app in 2017 which looks and feels
                            worse than Whatsapp, Slack, Snapchat or Fb messenger? We won't. So for us to make the
                            presence of our app felt, we must spend at least 100 thousand dollars to actually build
                            a finger licking beautiful product to launch it with the optimism that it will eat up
                            some of the market share of communication away from Whatsapp, FB messenger and Slack.
                            This implies that every waking hour of ours must go into the broad understanding of the
                            market, vision and team camaraderie first; then the development of the app, then the
                            launch of the app, and then following of metrics and somewhere along the way, dabbling
                            in projections will happen.

                            No traction yet for the main mobile app. Why? Why am I still pursuing investment when
                            there is not even a launch?
                            Because this product is about a chatapp. Chatting apps cannot be made and launched as
                            half baked MVPs for the world
                            We need investment to support the team so that our great team can continue to build a
                            great product with some confidence in the captain, that is I, that I will take care of
                            their bread and butter. Not everyone required in this team will have the same appetite
                            for risk as I.
                            Traction we have achieved so far: None. So far we were not chasing traction. We were
                            fighting personal odds and chasing a vision & design that required years of sacrifices
                            away from the norms of chasing traction common to apps with lesser time to chase vision,
                            because they are too busy chasing the incremental changes in the status quo.</i>

                        <br> <br>Peter Thiel became a billionaire by investing half a million dollars in Facebook
                        before
                        anyone else. Today he runs a fund which has invested in some of the world’s best startups.
                        <br><br>
                        Chattodo has a similar potential. You can be an investor in it by investing a half of what
                        Peter
                        Thiel did. This is a matter of a new kind of a social network.

                            <b> Why the standard question of traction may not be the most
                                appropriate question for a moonshot innovation in its nascent stage when
                                founders are seeking support from investors to continue their R&D
                                towards
                                launch?</b> <br><br>

                            For now, let's turn the lens on another kind of traction- which we have
                            already created- meaningful moments and activities noticed by users, media
                            and the tech community. <br><br>
                            I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing
                            traction instead of a chasing a world changing vision which did not fit the
                            bill for the rule of - build MVP - followed by traction, before I could
                            raise money. Please tell me how I would then change the world for the
                            better? <br><br>
                            Start-up land is littered with failure. <br><br>
                            Every hack on smart investing will preach that before approaching an
                            investor you must have dragged your feet over the thorns littered over that
                            holiest of grails- TRACTION. For after all what good is a business that does
                            not yield profits? Yet, if that critical question on TRACTION is duly asked
                            and answered before any investment, why the high rates of failure and a
                            subsequent celebration of failure as the norm in start-up land?
                            Could it be that the holy grail itself is flawed in a period where most of
                            our problems have been solved or are perceived to have been solved to an
                            acceptable degree beyond which improvements are not possible in a human,
                            hence imperfect world? <br><br>
                            I say YES. <br><br>
                            Most start-ups offer incremental changes, but what if you had a moon- shot
                            innovation for a problem the world has ceased to consider as one. Or a
                            problem considered solved? <br><br>
                            Moonshots, by their very definition, need to be hurtled until something big
                            is identified. The innovation after that identification might take time, in
                            some cases, a very long time. (Would you not say that the problem you are
                            addressing is a blind spot- that the best in chatting-productivity has been
                            achieved and that is just the start of the moon shot you must make to
                            disrupt existing models of education?)

                            for yet another chat app for people who were looking to be productive over
                            chats and the rest of the world did not agree with you.

                            Yes, you can’t code, don’t have the time to learn so you hire the best
                            to code for you. It must not surprise you that great people come at a
                            cost. Those great people may have had a life of their own before they
                            met a vision that I imparted to them and wished to be consumed by it but
                            for the mundane but real considerations of everyday living. <br><br>
                            More so, one requires neat sums of money for the world will not accept a
                            MVP that challenges its collective blind spot. <br><br>
                            So, my challenge is to manifest a never-before vision into a
                            finger-licking good looking product that elicits a collective gasp of
                            “why did we not see that earlier”, from the world. <br><br>
                            (To those who repeat the trite Form Follows Function rule, let me quote
                            just one example- Snapchat, that turned that norm on its head. It was a
                            beautiful but tedious product to begin with. It bettered itself over
                            time) <br><br>
                            Money, of course- now. <br><br>

                            <a href="http://preseeded.preseed.in">Preseeded.preseed.in</a> is being
                            planned
                            and built for the future more than the present status quo. <br> <br>
                            Reading it will keep your awareness about us, all the way, to the future. We
                            will soo pitch Chattodo to employees of companies like Twitter, Google etc.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For this I will be speaking directly with two of my good friends - YC
                            Almunus,
                            Sachin, who had also serveed as a Product manager Twitter. When that time
                            comes.
                            That is our core focused marketing which I will do myself. Through them I
                            will
                            try to get it into the hands of the employees of those companies. I will
                            focus
                            on that. That is the kind of start I want from my own marketing time spent.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So I build the product and pitch it to employees of top companies. That will
                            be
                            the highest use case of Chattodo I want to focus on that. And just that. It
                            entails, building a great product, and then talking to great people about
                            it.
                            <br> <br>
                            Also writing to best media blogs in the world about it. I want the start of
                            my
                            personal marketing effort to happen from there.
                            I will stick to what I am good at, writing, I will write a thorough article
                            about productivity and the future of roofless offices and distributed teams.
                            All
                            the way to how ideas can be built without capital and with Todoed and some
                            faith
                            in one another. This article would have the potential to be read by 1000s of
                            impactful early stage entrepreneurs.

                        web
                        products.
                        It is more of an art than app designing is. <br>
                        Lets first discuss that part of the marketing that is about acquiring users only: <br>
                        <br>
                        We need 1 extra ordinary marketer who could -: <br>
                        1. 100% organic marketing. We mean it. There will be no money for promotions (even if
                        money
                        is
                        not a

                        You need to be well networked in the global tech media community and should be active on

                        We value simplicity - in our world we pride ourselves on our design aesthetics. This
                        opening
                        is
                        not for anyone who feel their vibes flow strong with ours, unless you are someone with a
                        subtle
                        design sensibility and leadership fire to inspire a team of designers. Over the past few
                        years
                        we have learned that designers in themselves are a very different type of leader - one
                        we
                        would
                        need to balance out the Reactor Core. There are countless projects related to design
                        going
                        on in
                        Preseed and your role would require you to have hawkeyes over them along with the team
                        of
                        extraordinary talent built around you. If your values resonate with ours - connect with
                        someone
                        in the team, but before that - apply.</span><br>

                        <strong>Partner the geeks and hustlers and create marketable products by
                            design.</strong>
                        This is where extraordinary front end men and women look after those aspects of the
                        product
                        that the users will interact with. This is the team that finally makes Preseed products
                        marketable by design. <br><br>
                        This stage for Preseed typically starts when the initial idea is prototyped into a MVP
                        and
                        now it is time for it to start interacting with the users. <br><br>
                        Now let me elaborate a very important remark I just made, ‘ The team that makes products
                        marketable by design’, through the eyes of Preseed -: <br><br>
                        Step 1 — We get the geeks to hear our ideas, get inspired, code and deliver the MVP of
                        the
                        idea discussed. Until this point they handle the front end as hackers not as designers.
                        This
                        works to speedily get prototypes ready for our testing, may be sometimes even private
                        beta
                        launch because ‘we like to launch fast, even if the design is rather embarrassing’.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="./img/reid.png" alt="" class="img img-responsive">
                        <br><br>
                        Step 2 — The MVP is now ready for the play. Remember it is still not the best UI even
                        though
                        we can imagine it, for we don’t think we want to spend our resources to create the best
                        UI
                        for it yet, for it first needs to be launched to the real users. So once the MVP is
                        tested
                        privately, we open the exact same thing for the users, and then continue iterating till
                        we
                        see some customer traction <br><br>
                        Step 3 — This is when you come in. At this stage we have some real customer metrics.
                        This is
                        really when an idea starts looking like it is ready and worthy of more resources. The
                        MVP
                        now has a hand full of users using it, while it had designs that were not the kinds we
                        would
                        like to see in products we use as users. So clearly it is a good sign that the product
                        is
                        making sense even though it is not well designed. <br><br>
                        Step 4 — Marketing through design. Do you know what we mean? This is when the products
                        are
                        brought to the team at Ugly MVP. This is when Preseed Web Lab finds its front end
                        artists.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 5 — Once we have created a UI that work, we start distributing the product, through
                        media, popular bloggers, relevant forums, early adopters, distribution apps etc.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 6 — We keep trying till we either fail or we succeed. <br><br>
                        Step 7 — We move on to our next product. <br><br>
                        Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems
                        we
                        see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong
                        engineers. It’s a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web ‘design’
                        sensibilities. The reason stands — lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool
                        people.
                        We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products. <br><br>
                        For now we are looking for just 1 user interaction designer who is willing to commit
                        themselves to Preseed and its products/startups/clients. We won’t pay these designers
                        any
                        salary or immediate compensation. We will instead offer the designers upto 2% ownership
                        in
                        Preseed soon enough perhaps immediately after 3 months of our active working
                        relationship.

    This is stuff made of dreams. Once upon a time, there was a dream Nishchal had nurtured as a mere drawing for a new kind of a social network on his chart papers, backed with $100,000 worth of investments in 2009. Thereafter, Parag was among the first people to have joined Nishchal to build their first company in 2009. At that time Parag had just graduated from IIT Delhi. Nishchal is still on it, and Parag is just a call away. <br><br> Nishchal & Parag have shared a great relationship over the last 10 years while Nishchal was in the Himalayas and Parag was in San Francisco. They remain in touch to this day and exchange a great amount of knowledge about technology and startups globally.

                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                        <br>
                        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                        And having perhaps the better claim<br>
                        Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br>
                        Though as for that the passing there<br>
                        Had worn them really about the same,<br>
                        <br>
                        And both that morning equally lay<br>
                        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                        Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br>
                        I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
                        <br>
                        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
                        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br>
                        I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                        And that has made all the difference.<br>

                <strong>INTRODUCTION TO DAILY UPDATES PROCESS/protocol AT PRESEED STARTUPS </strong>
                <br> <br>
                Welcome to Preseed, where <br> <br>
                WE INSPIRE <br> <br>
                IDEAS I FAITH I ACTION <br> <br>
                Your decision to join Preseed is very inspirational and it clearly indicates your faith in
                Preseed culture.
                Here you not only get to perform at the highest level as an individual but you also have a
                strong team support. Apart from the tasks assigned to you, one of the most important
                protocols
                to act upon is the #daily-updates.
                Every morning, you have to update about your day to be, meaning the tasks you will perform
                during the day.
                <br> <br>

                At the end of the day you will need to update again on the tasks completed or worked upon
                and
                the status of it. this flow of communication will happen via #daily-updates channel on your
                startup's slack community.
                <br> <br>

                Length of your updates can be as small as you like. Daily update should not be looked as a
                botheration to anyone. It should be seen as a macro implication.
                <br> <br>

                The daily updates become a reference point of work for the next day.

                <br> <br>

                Imagine Preseed to be operating in a physical work space. Every morning you come to the
                office.
                The day begins with a 10 am meeting ritual with the captain. You discuss your daily
                activities
                and your day to be. Daily updates help Nishchal keep one individual's work well co ordinated
                with the 20 others , that collectively impact Preseed. Directly or indirectly. It also gives
                him
                a sense of daily activities in our organization. So update daily, regardless. The captain
                has to
                know at all times what his team is working on every single day.
                Daily update is just an unbiased update about whatever one did that day / the previous day,
                in
                brief. Planning is definitely important and worthy of an update.
                The daily update just needs to be a brief update strictly for a layman; when looking at the
                daily updates day by day, that lay man should feel there is progress.
                Hurry up. Join Slack. Start Updating!

                <h3>
                    Minutes Protocol
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Name of members
                    </li>
                    <li> Subject of meeting</li>
                    <li> Skype/hangouts/facetime/etc or in person?</li>
                    <li> Date must be recorded and in the title of the doc</li>
                    <li> Make and share a google doc with your relevant coordinators</li>
                    <li> Minutes should be written down in bullets and no point is to be missed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                Minutes document would contain the agenda(s) of the meeting as bullets and the discussion
                which
                took place for each agenda should be written down in sub bullets.
                <br><br>
                For example Extract of one of the one of the call MyIdeaList team meeting ,
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Daily Updates (one of our agenda agenda)</li>
                    <li>A asked team why were they not giving daily updates but B and C had no answer. A
                        asked
                        them to ensure they give daily updates.</li>
                    <li>Even if you guys do nothing please, do not mind posting that you have done nothing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Also what we can share what all we did today? something exciting?</li>
                    (all three are the brief of the discussion which took place regarding the agenda)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>
                    The Minutes of Meeting that is done among two or more team members need to be recorded
                    and
                    shared within 24 hours so that there is speed with transparency to fuel our progress. I
                    think the idea of the Minutes are pretty clear but the following are some guidelines.

                </strong>
                <br><br>
                Minutes will be shared in relevant fb workgroups, not emails unless specified. If you
                remember
                my last post about minutes here. I clearly specified its got to be in the workgroup.
                <br><br>
                However, the conclusion from the minutes would go into relevant spreadsheets. <br><br>
                For Example; So when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thind.aman">Aman Thind</a> shares the
                minute here the coordinators will take the relevant elements the right folder. <br><br>
                Nishchal and coordinators, keep themselves tuned with activities across Preseed through
                following them on slack channels, through the cc: coordinator@preseed.in , and through
                minutes
                on google doc of your significant interactions on other mediums of communication. So sharing
                minutes doc is so important.

                How are teams built? - Other team members' contribution to finding new talents for their team is
                paramount.
                Each one should take upon themselves in growing their teams. <br> So I am clearly saying if you talent
                around you
                with counter culture beliefs that resonate with Preseed values, create introductions of such people with
                us,
                <br> along with your views on what agenda could we build upon with the fellow being you have found for
                us.
                <br>
                Delegation of work - MOST IMPORTANT Everyone must learn over a period of time of course, 'the art of
                building their own team'. <br> The biggest attribute we see in our people is 'how well can they inspire
                others to
                work with them' if you need money to build your team then you need to see how Nishchal is building his
                team.

                            The purpose of this protocol, is to ensure that every Preseed Team members’
                            communication is effective
                            and uniform so that we all follow certain protocols that define our
                            communications
                            well with each other.
                            Key here is to be fast and mindful. Empathise with other team members who you
                            are
                            communicating with.

                        <li>People already get a lot of actionable emails to deal with on a daily basis so

                            ​*team channels / groups*​ and ​*not DM’s*​ so that the rest of the team can be
                            included as well as
                            learn from the conversation that takes place. Another reason is to be able to
                            amplify the reach of
                            messages (when needed) and protocols from Preseed team to reach other teams in
                            Preseed — which in turn
